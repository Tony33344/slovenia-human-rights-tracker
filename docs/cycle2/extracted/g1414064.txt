            5.      CRC recommended that Slovenia bring the Ombudsman’s Office into compliance
            with the Paris Principles.20 CAT urged Slovenia to provide this Office with adequate
            resources21 and to broaden its mandate to carry out investigations into allegations of torture
            and ill-treatment.22
            6.     CRC welcomed the creation of a Child Observatory.23 It recommended that Slovenia
            strengthen the mandate of the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal
            Opportunities to enable it to effectively coordinate the implementation of the Convention.24
            7.     In 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women
            (CEDAW) noted the establishment, in 2010, of an inter-ministerial working group to

            from discrimination.25
            8.    CERD welcomed the National Programme of Measures for Roma People (2010–

            CRC urged Slovenia to repeal provisions of the Marriage and Family Relations Act that
            were not compliant with the Convention.29

 C.   Cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner
      for Human Rights

      10.   Slovenia contributed financially to the Office of the United Nations High
      Commissioner for Human Rights between 2009 and 2013, including to the United Nations
      Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture in 2009.41


III. Implementation of international human rights obligations,
     taking into account applicable international
     humanitarian law

 A.   Equality and non-discrimination

      11.    CERD was concerned that very few acts of racial discrimination had been
      prosecuted and requested to Slovenia that appropriate provisions be made available in
      national legislation.42 CAT recommended that Slovenia take measures aimed at preventing
      ethnically motivated crimes.43


                                                                                                                 5
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/2


           12.     CERD remained concerned about marginalization and discrimination of Roma, and
           urged Slovenia to combat discrimination against them and implement special measures in
           education, housing, health and employment.44 CRC remained seriously concerned about
           persistent discrimination against Roma children.45 CRC recommended that Slovenia
           investigate and prosecute any discriminatory act directed at Roma children.46
           13.     In 2011, the independent expert on water and sanitation recommended that Slovenia
           eliminate all forms of discrimination which deprived certain segments of the population of
           access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and ensure that any instances of discrimination
           be fully investigated and prosecuted, and that redress be provided to the victims.47
           14.    CRC was seriously concerned that the rights of former permanent residents of
           Slovenia originating from former Yugoslavian republics (the so-called “erased”), whose
           legal status was unlawfully revoked in 1992, had not been guaranteed.48 CAT was
           concerned about persistent discrimination against the “erased” persons and encouraged
           Slovenia to facilitate their full integration.49 CERD remained concerned about difficulties
           they were facing in securing access to social and economic rights,50 and recommended that
           Slovenia ensure the full enjoyment of the economic and social rights of “erased” people,
           including health, social security, education and employment.51
           15.    Concerning the “erased”, CRC noted with appreciation the Act Regulating the Legal
           Status of Citizens of Former Yugoslavia Living in the Republic of Slovenia in 2010
           (8 March 2010) (Legal Status Act).52
           16.    In 2013, CAT remained concerned that Slovenia had failed to enforce the Legal
           Status Act.53 CRC was particularly concerned that a large number of persons were excluded
           from this Act, and that applications of “erased” people were rejected.54
           17.    CRC recommended that Slovenia simplify the proceedings for obtaining permanent
           residence permits by “erased” people.55 CAT recommended the restoration of the
           permanent resident status of these persons, and encouraged Slovenia to guarantee fair
           procedures in applying for citizenship.56 CERD recommended that Slovenia grant full
           reparation to all individuals affected by the “erasure”.57
           18.     In 2013, as part of the reply to CERD recommendations issued in 2010, Slovenia
           stated, inter alia, that in 2010 the Government had set up a Working Group on
           Comprehensive Resolving of the Issue of the Erased, with a view to elaborating measures
           for the reintegration of such persons into society.58
           19.    CRC was concerned that children of same-sex couples faced discrimination in
           school based on their family’s sexual orientation. It urged Slovenia to regularize the status
           of such children.59


      B.   Right to life, liberty and security of the person

           20.     CAT urged Slovenia to ensure prompt, impartial and effective investigation into all
           allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to prosecute perpetrators of such acts,60 and
           recommended measures concerning the audio and video recording of all interrogations of
           detainees as means to prevent torture and ill-treatment.61 It also urged the country to
           provide redress and compensation for victims,62 and to abolish the statute of limitations for
           the crime of torture.63
           21.     In 2012, in a follow-up to CAT concluding observations, Slovenia reported, inter
           alia, that the powers of the Department for Investigation and Prosecution of Official
           Persons with Special Authorizations had been expanded and that it was competent to
           investigate and prosecute abuses of all kinds of official persons with official authorization.64

22.    While welcoming measures aimed at improving detention conditions, CAT
remained concerned about overcrowding in a number of prisons. It urged Slovenia to bring
detention conditions into line with international standards.65
23.    CAT recommended close monitoring by the judicial organs of any placements in
psychiatric institutions, regular visits by independent monitoring bodies and guaranteeing
the implementation of safeguards.66
24.   CAT remained concerned about violence against women and girls and
recommended, inter alia, that Slovenia prevent and prosecute all forms of violence against
women and children, including domestic violence, and implement the National Programme
of Family Violence Prevention (2009–2014).67
25.    CRC expressed concern about the narrow definition of violence provided within the
Domestic Violence Prevention Act,68 and the limited definition of violence against children
in national legislation.69 It recommended (a) a comprehensive definition of violence to
include all forms of violence, including sexual exploitation and abuse of children;70 (b) a
comprehensive national strategy to prevent and address all forms of violence against
children;71 and (c) the establishment of an investigation and prosecution mechanism.72 It
urged Slovenia to ban all forms of abuse and neglect of children in all settings, ensure
follow-up to cases of abuse or neglect and establish community protection mechanisms.73
CRC noted with concern that Roma girls were often subject to sexual violence and
exploitation by family members.74
26.     CRC was concerned that corporal punishment in educational day-care centres,
residential school institutions and penal institutions was not explicitly prohibited.75 CRC
recommended that Slovenia explicitly prohibit in national legislation corporal punishment
in all settings, including at home, and amend the Criminal Code as well as the Foster Care
Act.76 It recommended that Slovenia strengthen its efforts to address corporal punishment
by, inter alia, launching awareness-raising campaigns.
27.     CAT welcomed the designation of human trafficking as a crime but remained
concerned about trafficking of women for prostitution in Slovenia.77 CRC was also
concerned that Slovenia remained a country of origin, destination and transit for trafficking
and sexual exploitation of children.78 CAT urged Slovenia to combat trafficking in persons,
especially in women and children, by prosecuting perpetrators and ensuring redress,
including compensation and rehabilitation, for victims.79 CRC welcomed the Action Plan of
the Intergovernmental Working Group for Countering Trafficking in Human Beings (2012-
2013)80 and recommended that this Working Group be empowered.81
28.   CRC was concerned about increasing incidents of the sale of Roma girls. It
recommended targeted measures to prevent the sale of children, child prostitution and child
pornography.82
29.    CRC recommended that Slovenia take measures to prevent forced labour of children
and establish mechanisms to investigate and prosecute child forced labour.83 CRC also
recommended the full harmonization of Slovenian national legislation with OP-CRC-SC,
particularly by explicitly prohibiting the sale of children and forced adoptions.84
30.     CRC recommended that Slovenia (a) put an end to forced and underage marriages of
Roma children;85 (b) investigate such cases with a view to bringing perpetrators to justice;
(c) increase awareness-raising within the Roma population on the harmful impact of early
marriage on children; (d) provide victims with rehabilitation and counselling services;86 and
(e) protect children who are victims of forced marriage.87




                                                                                                     7
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/2


      C.   Administration of justice and the rule of law

           31.    Concerned about the high proportion of remand prisoners awaiting trial, CAT
           recommended that Slovenia reduce the backlog of court cases, including by taking non-
           custodial measures.88
           32.     CRC also expressed concern about the lack of special provisions for children in its
           Criminal Code and urged Slovenia to bring its juvenile justice system fully into line with
           relevant standards. It recommended that deprivation of liberty of children be a measure of
           last resort.89


      D.   Freedom of expression, right to participate in public and political life

           33.   UNESCO recommended that Slovenia decriminalize defamation in the Penal Code
           and place it within the civil code,90 and that the insult provisions and their penalties be
           reformed to be better aligned with international standards on freedom of expression.91
           34.    CERD recommended that Slovenia protect minorities in their political rights without
           discrimination, and ensure representation of all minorities in Parliament and in regional
           elected bodies.92
           35.   CEDAW expressed regret that Slovenia had not taken steps to increase the number
           of women mayors in the country.93


      E.   Right to work and to just and favourable conditions of work

           36.     The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and
           Recommendations (CEACR) took note of the adoption of the Act implementing the
           principle of equal treatment explicitly applicable to cases of anti-union discrimination.94
           CEACR requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that national
           legislation contain specific provisions prohibiting acts of interference by employers or their
           organizations in the establishment, functioning and administration of workers’
           organizations, and establishing effective and sufficiently dissuasive sanctions against such
           acts.95
           37.     CEACR asserted that it had previously noted the need for systematic measures
           aimed at the integration of migrant workers and their families in society.96 CEACR also
           stated that it had previously noted concerns raised by the Association of Free Trade Unions
           regarding substandard housing conditions of migrant workers and the need to strengthen
           supervision in this regard, and to establish minimum standards of living for them.97


      F.   Right to social security and to an adequate standard of living

           38.    The independent expert on water and sanitation recommended that Slovenia allocate
           more funds for research into the issue of poverty in Slovenia, as the current statistics
           possibly did not fully reflect the extent to which people were living in poverty in the
           country.98
           39.    CRC was highly concerned that the number of children living in poverty was
           increasing and that children of minority groups, particularly Roma, were poorer than
           children of the majority population. It recommended that Slovenia build a national system
           of social protection.99




8
                                                                                      A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/2


     40.     The independent expert on safe drinking water and sanitation recommended that
     Slovenia explicitly recognize the rights to water and to sanitation in law, make them
     justiciable and amend relevant laws to reflect these human rights obligations.100 She
     recommended that Slovenia (a) urgently address the situation of people, especially Roma
     communities, who did not have access to safe drinking water and sanitation; and (b)
     implement measures to ensure that their rights to water and sanitation were fully
     protected.101
     41.    CERD remained concerned about the de facto segregation and discrimination related
     to housing of the Roma minority. It recommended that Slovenia strengthen its measures
     aimed at improving the housing conditions of the Roma and refrain from placing Roma in
     isolated camps without access to health care and other basic facilities.102


G.   Right to health

     42.    CRC was concerned about the ethnic disparity in access to, and provision of, health
     services. It recommended that all children have similar access to basic health services and
     urged Slovenia to implement the "Strategy for enhancing health and action plan for
     reducing inequalities in health in the Pomurje region".103
     43.   Concerned that suicide was the second major cause of mortality among children
     aged 10-14 in Slovenia, CRC urged Slovenia to finalize the National Programme for
     Mental Health.104


H.   Right to education

     44.    CRC was concerned about the lack of holistic programmes for early childhood
     development as well as the introduction of new education fees. It recommended that
     Slovenia develop well-financed early childhood development programmes and refrain from
     introducing more education-related fees.105
     45.     UNESCO strongly encouraged Slovenia to pursue its positive efforts to integrate
     human rights education into the educational system and training programs, and intensify its
     efforts in ensuring the effectiveness of equal access to education.106
     46.    CRC remained concerned that Roma children enjoyed limited access to education.107
     Concerned about segregation of Roma children in schools, CERD recommended that Roma
     children enjoy equal opportunities in access to quality education at all levels.108 CRC
     recommended, inter alia, that Slovenia raise the enrolment of Roma children in preschool
     educational institutions and integrate them in mainstream education.109


I.   Persons with disabilities

     47.     While noting with satisfaction the 2007–2013 Action Programme for Persons with
     Disabilities, CRC encouraged Slovenia to allocate resources for its effective
     implementation. It also recommended that Slovenia ensure that children with disabilities
     fully enjoy their rights.110


J.   Minorities

     48.   CERD was concerned about public manifestations of hate speech and intolerance by
     some politicians in the media towards minorities. It recommended that Slovenia combat



                                                                                                        9
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/2


           prejudices against ethnic minorities, and investigate and prosecute all acts of political
           discourse against minorities.111
           49.    CRC urged Slovenia to reduce disparities in the enjoyment of rights between
           children of minority groups, particularly Roma children, and children of the majority
           population.112
           50.     The independent expert on sanitation and drinking water noted laws that introduced
           a distinction between “autochthonous” and “non-autochthonous” Roma communities, and
           recommended eliminating this distinction in order to ensure the equality of rights of all
           Roma people.113
           51.   She also recommended that Slovenia provide security of tenure to all Roma
           communities by taking measures to regularize their settlements,114 and ensure that the
           National Programme of Measures for Roma (2010–2015) be implemented in all
           municipalities.115


      K.   Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers

           52.    CAT urged Slovenia to ensure that the principle of non-refoulement be established
           and ensure procedural safeguards against refoulement.116 In the framework of follow-up,
           Slovenia reported to CAT that the new Aliens Act enacted in 2011 included a non-
           refoulement principle.117
           53.     CRC expressed concern about Slovenia’s decision to decrease by 50 per cent the
           financial assistance provided to asylum seekers staying outside the Asylum Home, and
           recommended that it reconsider this decision.118 It also recommended that Slovenia, inter
           alia, (a) refrain from regular conduct of age assessment tests and ensure that such
           procedures be taken only as a measure of last resort;119 and (b) provide all unaccompanied
           minors with legal assistance.120 CRC recommended that Slovenia provide all children
           seeking refuge, and who had fled from war zones, with social reintegration programmes.121
