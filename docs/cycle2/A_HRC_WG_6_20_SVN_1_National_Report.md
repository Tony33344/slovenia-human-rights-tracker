           Information provided by stakeholders

      A.   Background and framework

           Institutional and human rights infrastructure and policy measures
           1.      Amnesty International (AI) stated that despite the fact that several institutions were
           tasked with ensuring non-discrimination (including the Human Rights Ombudsman, the
           Advocate of the Principle of Equality inspectorates and courts), the mandates of these
           institutions lacked clarity and none were responsible for the overall coordination of anti-
           discrimination policy, monitoring and proposing systemic solutions.2 AI recommended to
           broaden the mandate and powers of the institutions tasked with guaranteeing the principle
           of equality and non-discrimination including capacities to monitor actions by both state and
           private actors and to impose legally binding measures.3
           2.      The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (EU-FRA) affirmed that aside
           from the Human Rights Ombudsman, the only human rights areas covered by institutions
           were non-discrimination/equality (Advocate of the principle of equality) and personal data
           protection (Information Commissioner). It asserted that that no other body existed that was
           explicitly dedicated to the protection of persons with disabilities (apart from the non-
           discrimination aspect), to the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, or to the
           rights of detainees.4
           3.      The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of
           National Minorities of the Council of Europe (CoE-ACFC) underscored that the Office of
           the Human Rights Ombudsman continued to play an important role in combating
           discrimination based on ethnicity and to advance on minority rights.5 AI stated that the
           Human Rights Ombudsman was only mandated to monitor actions by state agents, had no
           oversight function of actions by private or non-state actors ,was only mandated to take
           action when it received a complaint6 and its recommendations were not legally binding.7
           EU-FRA stated that the Human Rights Ombudsman possessed a wide range of powers in
           relation to individual complaints and litigation involving infringement of public freedoms
           and liberties (including arbitrary exercise of powers or inaction by public bodies which
           often overlap with human rights violations).8
           4.     Regarding the Office of the Advocate of the Principle of Equality, AI asserted it was
           mandated to receive and examine alleged cases of discrimination in private and public
           sectors but however, its opinions were not legally binding, and it was not mandated to
           monitor situations of vulnerable groups or coordinate the state policy to combat
           discrimination.9 AI affirmed that this Office had now one employee, namely the Advocate
           himself, and that the Government had not provided it with sufficient powers and
           resources.10
           5.     EU-FRA asserted that the Office for Equal Opportunities was closed down in April
           2012 and its staff, including the Advocate of the Principle of Equality, was transferred to
           the Equal Opportunities and European Coordination Service under the authority of the
           Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.11 CoE-ACFC
           highlighted that the powers of the Advocate of the Principle of Equality appeared to be
           particularly ineffective to protect victims of discrimination and, more generally, to prevent
           and monitor discrimination in society, that this institution lacked independence, financial
           and human resources and that its competences were very limited.12

     6.     EU-FRA stated that concerns regarding the independence of equality bodies from
     central Government may give rise to unfavourable perceptions, affecting the confidence of
     victims to approach them.13
     7.     AI asserted that State Inspectorates had powers to provide effective remedy to
     victims of discrimination and that however, the Housing inspectorate said in 2010 that
     cases of alleged discrimination by a public or private actor on housing issues would not fall
     under its mandate.14
     8.      EU-FRA asserted that the Slovenian Ministry of Interior adopted a resolution to
     establish a national plan on the Prevention and Combating of Crime 2012-2016, which,
     among other goals, aimed at strengthening the protection and support to victims through
     financial and psychological aid.15


B.   Implementation of international human rights obligations, taking into
     account applicable international humanitarian law

1.   Equality and non-discrimination
     9.      CoE-ACFC affirmed in 2011 that substantial improvements are needed to ensure
     effective protection against discrimination, and in particular, access to effective remedies
     for potential victims of discrimination. It also asserted that prejudices against some groups,
     in particular Roma and “persons belonging to the new national communities”(persons
     belonging to the Albanian, Bosniac, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin and Serbian
     nations of the former Yugoslavia), continue to be disseminated through some media and in
     the political arena, and that local authorities are sometimes reluctant to implement laws and
     policies in relation to Roma and incidents of demonstrations of hostility against them have
     taken place at the local level.16
     10.    AI recommended to: address discrimination by public and private actors as a matter
     of priority; provide effective remedies to victims of discrimination; and implement
     international recommendations on collecting data disaggregated by the prohibited grounds
     of discrimination.17
     11.     The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe (CoE-CM) provided
     recommendations to Slovenia on a number of issues for immediate action, inter alia, to
     intensify measures to ensure that effective remedies are available to potential victims of
     discrimination and to intensify actions to raise awareness of discrimination-related issues in
     society, including in the judiciary and law enforcement agencies.18 CoE-CM also
     recommended to make further efforts to combat all forms of intolerance and hate speech
     targeting persons belonging to minorities and other groups.19
     12.    CoE-ACFC welcomed the fact that the authorities recently set up a working group to
     remedy shortcomings by means of the elaboration of a general strategy to combat
     discrimination and to improve the implementation of existing remedies and expressed that
     it expected that this work will significantly improve the efficiency of the mechanisms to
     combat discrimination.20
     13.    On the so called “erased”, AI informed that on 26 February 1992, some 25.671
     people were unlawfully removed from the Slovenian registry of permanent residents, being
     mainly people from other republics of the former Yugoslavia who had been living in
     Slovenia but who had not acquired Slovenian citizenship following independence of the
     country.21 AI added that these persons without a legal status were deprived of their
     economic, social and political rights.22




                                                                                                           3
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/3


            14.     AI stated that Slovenia had failed to enact legislation to recognize the rights of the
            “erased”.23 It underscored that Slovenia had also failed to restore permanent residency to
            the “erased”, and that the 2010 legislation aimed at regulating the restoration of their legal
            status expired in July 2013, and the “erased” have now no legal options to regulate their
            status, while 674 of a total of 987 filed applications for permanent residence permit were
            pending.24 CoE-CM recommended in 2012 to promote an inclusive interpretation of the
            new Act Regulating the Legal Status of citizens of Former Yugoslavia living in the
            Republic of Slovenia with a view to giving retroactive access to permanent residence to as
            many as possible of those who were “erased” in 1992.25
            15.    The Council of Europe Commissioner of Human Rights (CoE-Commissioner)
            asserted in 2013 that the low number of applications and granted requests for permanent
            residence appear to indicate a lack of effectiveness of the exiting legislation and its
            implementation and expressed his serious concern that the majority of the “erased” who
            have not yet settled their residence status in Slovenia will not succeed in doing so before
            the expiration of the July 2013 deadline.26
            16.     AI affirmed that by December 2013, the authorities had prepared legislation on a
            compensation scheme for the “erased”, and that however, compensation measures include
            only those who have already regulated their status, and thus exclude approximately half of
            the “erased”.27 AI added that remedies for the “erased” under domestic law consist only of
            financial compensation, which -according to the “erased”- is set too low, and that no other
            form of reparation, including restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-
            repetition has been offered to them.28
            17.     AI recommended to immediately enforce the automatic return of appropriate legal
            status to all “erased” without additional conditions of administrative fees; officially
            recognize “erasure” as a human rights violation and offer a state apology; ensure prompt,
            effective, impartial and independent investigations by a special body or truth commission
            with high competence and adequate resources, into violations connected to the “erasure”;
            ensure individuals or institutions found responsible for committing these violations are held
            to account; regulate and enable reunification of families; revise compensation schemes to
            the “erased” following amounts and criteria set out by the European Court of Human
            Rights; and ensure reintegration measures for the “erased”.29
            18.    CoE-Commissioner stressed that access to a state’s nationality should be possible
            whenever a person has a genuine and effective link with this state in particular through
            birth, descent or residence, and that the situation of “erasure” has disproportionately
            affected persons belonging to the most vulnerable social groups such as the Roma.30 CoE-
            Commissioner urged authorities to take all relevant measures in order to facilitate and make
            possible the acquisition these persons of Slovenian citizenship with particular attention to
            the children of those “erased” in 1992 who are still stateless.31 It added that as a first step
            the authorities could consider establishing a complete register of all the “erased” persons
            who have become and remain stateless.32

       2.   Right to life, liberty and security of the person
            19.     The Council of Europe (CoE) referred to the fact that the European Committee for
            the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CoE-CPT)
            received few isolated allegations of excessive use of force by hooded members of police
            special units in the context of apprehension, and recommended that no more force than is
            strictly necessary should be used when effecting an apprehension. CoE-CPT also noted that
            there can never be any justification for striking apprehended persons once they have been
            brought under control.33

20.     CoE-CPT asserted that, in general, the practical operation of fundamental safeguards
against ill-treatment did not pose major difficulties. It recommended that Slovenian
authorities take the necessary steps to ensure that, in practice, all detained persons
effectively benefit from the right of access to a lawyer from the very outset of their
deprivation of liberty.34
21.    CoE-CPT acknowledged efforts made by the Slovenian authorities to increase the
capacity of the prison estate but that nevertheless, overcrowding continued to be a problem
in some prison establishments.35 CoE-CPT encouraged the authorities to pursue their
endeavours to combat prison overcrowding, including through increased application of non-
custodial measures during the period before any imposition of a sentence.36
22.   CoE-CPT considered that prisoners held under reinforced security regime should be
provided with tailored programmes of purposeful activities of varied nature.37
23.     CoE-CPT recommended that steps be taken so that doctors working in prison
establishments draw a conclusion as to the consistency between the descriptions of injuries
observed and any allegations of ill-treatment made by the persons concerned. It also
recommended that reports relating to injuries consistent with possible ill-treatment (even in
the absence of allegations) should be automatically forwarded to an independent body
empowered to conduct investigations into the matter.38
24.    CoE-CPT emphasized that the care of forensic patients must always remain under
the responsibility of the hospital staff within the forensic psychiatric units and care facilities
of the Psychiatric Department and that whenever the intervention of prison staff assigned to
the units is required, it must take place in accordance with the instructions of hospital staff
and under the latter’s close supervision.39
25.    Regarding psychiatric establishments, CoE-CPT welcomed the adoption in July
2008 of the new Mental Health Act which, inter alia, reinforced the legal protection of
patients.40 CoE-CPT asserted that it is essential that all means are tried before recourse to
mechanical restraint, a measure which may exceptionally be necessary to deal with an
imminent risk of injury and which should never be used as a punishment or as a means of
convenience.41 It recommended that Slovenian authorities take steps to reflect, in both law
and practice, the principle of a patient’s free and informed consent to treatment.42
26.     EU-FRA stated that in Slovenia the criminal law definition of family violence
includes various aspects of subordination and discriminatory treatment43, and that its
legislation reflects the repetitive nature of intimate partner violence.44 In 2013 EU-FRA
asserted that Slovenia adopted a national action plan to combat general domestic violence
or specifically violence against children.45
27.    EU-FRA stated that Slovenia still did not explicitly forbid corporal punishment of
children.46 Global Initiative to End All Corporal Punishment of Children (GIEACPC) stated
that in Slovenia, corporal punishment of children was lawful in the home, in alternative
care settings and in some day care settings47, despite recommendations of treaty monitoring
bodies.48 GIEACPC explained that despite the Government’s positive introduction of
prohibiting legislation, it was rejected by public referendum in 2012.49
28.    EU-FRA affirmed that Slovenia amended its penal code in 2011 by introducing the
criminalisation of grooming and defining various activities under the offence of child
pornography.50
29.    EU-FRA stated that Slovenia took legislative steps extending the level of protection
offered to victims of trafficking to include victims of illegal employment.51
30.   The Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings of the
Council of Europe (CoE-GRETA) stated that steps were taken by Slovenian authorities to


                                                                                                          5
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/3


            prevent and combat trafficking, including the criminalisation of human trafficking, the
            appointment of a National Coordinator, the drafting and implementation of national action
            plans for combatting trafficking by the Inter-ministerial Working Group for Combatting
            Trafficking in Human Beings and awareness-raising measures.52 CoE-GRETA stated that
            future actions in the area of prevention should be designed and efforts to discourage
            demand for services from trafficked persons should be strengthened.53
            31.     CoE-GRETA invited Slovenian authorities to invest in the human and financial
            resources of the secretariat of the Working Group and the National Co-ordinator dealing
            with trafficking in human beings (THB) so that they can effectively carry out the full range
            of tasks within their mandate.54 CoE-GRETA invited Slovenian authorities to introduce a
            periodic independent evaluation of the Action Plan for 2012-2013 and to consider the
            establishment of an independent national rapporteur or other mechanism for monitoring the
            anti-trafficking activities of State Institutions.55
            32.     As highlighted by the CoE, CoE-GRETA considered that the Slovenian authorities
            should take further steps to ensure that the human rights-based and victim-centred approach
            was fully reflected in the national policy to combat THB.56 CoE-GRETA stressed the need
            to address THB as a form of violence against women and to take account of gender-specific
            types of exploitation, as well as the particular situation of child victims of trafficking.57
            CoE-GRETA noted with satisfaction that the definition of THB states explicitly the
            irrelevance of the consent of a victim of trafficking to the intended exploitation.58
            33.     CoE-GRETA urged authorities to ensure that access to assistance for victims of
            trafficking is not made conditional on their co-operation in the investigation and criminal
            proceedings.59
            34.    CoE-GRETA expressed concern that no victims of trafficking have obtained
            compensation in Slovenia and urged Slovenian authorities to facilitate and guarantee access
            to compensation for victims of trafficking including by providing them with legal aid and
            enlarging the scope of application of the Crime Victim Compensation Act.60
            35.     CoE-GRETA urged the Slovenian authorities to make full use of protection
            measures for victims and witnesses, and stressed the need both to strengthen the training
            provided to judges and prosecutors on the issue of human trafficking as well as to
            encourage the law enforcement and prosecution services to develop their specialisation with
            a view to improving the collection of evidence to enable the successful prosecution of
            traffickers.61
            36.     CoE-GRETA invited Slovenian authorities to continue exploring further possibilities
            for strengthening international co-operation in the investigation and prosecution of human
            trafficking cases, as well as developing international co-operation for the purpose of
            preventing THB and providing assistance to victims.62

       3.   Administration of justice, including impunity (part to be added only if relevant), and
            the rule of law
            37.     The Group of States against Corruption of the Council of Europe (CoE-GRECO)
            asserted that judges suffer from a lack of trust by the public seemingly as a result of judicial
            backlogs, weak internal management of courts and lack of a public relations policy.63 CoE-
            GRECO also stated that judges were subject to strict specific rules on incompatibilities,
            conflicts of interest and others but that however, there is room for improvement as regards
            for instance the process of selection, nomination and promotion of judges.64
            38.     CoE-GRECO recommended that authorities consider revisiting the procedure of
            appointment of judges to the Supreme Court, in order to minimise the possibilities of
            political influence65, and that a set of clear standards/code of professional conduct be


6
                                                                                        A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/3


     established which would cover in scope all judges.66 CoE-GRECO recommended that the
     criteria of selection and evaluation of judges be further developed with the aim of
     enhancing their uniformity, predictability and transparency.67
     39.    CoE-GRECO recommended that Slovenian authorities ensure that the Ministry of
     the Interior exercises its authority over the prosecution service in such a way as not to
     undermine prosecutors’ integrity and create risks of improper influence.68 CoE-GRECO
     mentioned the lack of transparency, weak internal management and poor communication
     with the public as main criticisms to prosecutors. It also stated that these needed to be
     addressed by strengthening the managerial and oversight role of the State Prosecutor
     General and the State Prosecutorial Council and by devoting more efforts to a
     communication policy with the public and the media.69
     40.     AI stated that victims of discrimination can seek judicial remedies before the lower
     courts as well as before the Constitutional Court. However, proceedings are slow and legal
     aid is not commonly available.70 AI expressed that Slovenian authorities have yet to
     establish an effective legal and institutional framework to give victims of human rights
     violations access to an accessible affordable and timely remedy.71 EU-FRA informed that
     the Slovenian National Assembly adopted two acts introducing specific measures to
     accelerate proceedings before courts.72
     41.    CoE-CPT reiterated its recommendation that remand prisoners be offered the same
     safeguards as sentenced prisoners during disciplinary procedures, including the right to be
     heard in person by the deciding authority, prior to the imposition of any sanction.73

4.   Freedom of religion or belief, expression, association and peaceful assembly, and right
     to participate in public and political life
     42.    Following the Assessment Mission of the Early Elections of the National Assembly
     (4 December 2011), the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the
     Organizations for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE/ODIHR) affirmed in 2012
     that there were no obstacles to campaigning, and freedoms of speech, movement and
     association were respected at all times.74 OSCE/ODIHR recommended that political party
     financial reports provide a detailed breakdown of all donations and that detailed versions of
     the reports should be publicly accessible.75 OSCE/ODIHR affirmed that consideration could
     be given to the possibility of giving a single institution the jurisdiction as well as the
     resources to scrutinise the financial operations of political parties and campaign
     organisers.76
     43.    OSCE/ODIHR also said that consideration could be given to having one media
     regulatory body with the expertise, resources and mandate to monitor respect for campaign
     related rules, investigate alleged violations, and impose effective remedies when violations
     take place, and that clear procedures should be established to receive and act upon
     complaints about unfair or unlawful media coverage.77 OSCE/ODIHR said that in order to
     avoid ambiguity and uncertainty, including potential conflict of jurisdiction, legal
     provisions could be revised to establish a uniform, hierarchical dispute procedure for all
     decisions and acts of electoral commissions.78
     44.    OSCE/ODIHR stated that the representation of women in political life has been low
     but has increased slowly over the past decade and that following the full implementation of
     a gender quota in the 4 December 2011 election, the percentage of women elected increased
     to 31 percent, as compared to 13 percent after the 2008 elections.79
     45.    OSCE/ODIHR recommended that results disaggregated by polling station be made
     publicly available, and that the National Election Commission instructions be clarified to
     ensure that secrecy of the vote is fully ensured for all instances.80



                                                                                                          7
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/3


            46.     Regarding the “erased”, OSCE/ODIHR stated in February 2012 that since July
            2010, the status of some 13.000 people has not yet been regulated, and that while this issue
            does not directly deal with citizenship, the lack of permanent residence could indirectly
            affect their right to obtain citizenship and voting rights.81

       5.   Right to work and to just and favourable conditions of work
            47.     The European Committee on Social Rights (CoE-ECSR) asserted that the minimum
            levels of sickness and unemployment benefits as well as the minimum level of pension
            benefit are manifestly inadequate, and that the duration of unemployment benefit is too
            short.82
            48.     EU-FRA stated that the lowest gender pay gaps in the EU in 2010 are found, among
            others in Slovenia (4.4%).83

       6.   Right to social security and to an adequate standard of living
            49.    CoE-ECSR took note in 2013 of Intervention Measures due to the Economic Crisis
            Act and the introduction of the financial Social Assistance Acts which led to changes in the
            field of financial social assistance and social benefits which have been so far associated
            with pensions (minimum pension supplement) or age (state pension). It recalled that
            measures taken to consolidate public finances may be considered as a necessary means to
            ensure the maintenance and sustainability of the social security system and that however,
            any modifications should not undermine the effective social protection of all members of
            society against social and economic risks and should not transform the social security
            system into a basic social assistance system.84
            50.   AI affirmed that denial of the rights to adequate housing, water and sanitation of
            Roma impacts their rights to education, work and health, and feeds into a cycle of poverty
            and marginalization.85
            51.     AI stated that measures to improve the living conditions of Roma remained largely
            unimplemented in informal Roma settlements. 86 AI also stated that many Roma in the
            South East of the country live in isolated and segregated settlements, with limited access to
            services such as water, electricity, sanitation and transport, and that widespread
            discrimination often prevents Romani families from buying or renting housing in other
            areas.87
            52.     AI explained that Roma settlements are often established in an irregular manner and
            on land not classified for residential use, leading to insecurity of tenure.88 AI affirmed that a
            legal title and building permit are pre-conditions for access to public services such as water,
            sanitation and electricity.89 AI highlighted that Slovenian legislation does not prohibit
            forced evictions and does not include the minimum procedural requirements to protect
            residents from eviction and that in a number of Roma settlements the residents are at risk of
            imminent eviction.90
            53.    CoE-ACFC stated the situation of Roma in the area of housing remains very
            precarious, in particular in the region of Dolenjska, where many Roma settlements have no
            access to running water or electricity, and that substantial improvements were required in
            the areas of education, access to employment and health care.91
            54.    AI recommended to: ensure access to water, sanitation and electricity for all Roma
            communities; confer security of tenure for people living in informal settlements; provide all
            individuals with legal protection against forced evictions; legalize settlements where
            possible or offer other solutions in genuine consultation with affected communities; stop
            potential forced evictions in Dobruska vas Roma settlement; and prioritise participation of

      Romani communities living in informal settlements in all public housing policies and
      programmes.92

 7.   Right to health
      55.     CoE-ECSR asserted that a very small group of people (approximately 30.000) who
      do not have citizenship or residence in Slovenia are not covered by compulsory health
      insurance.93 CoE-ECSR affirmed that while access to health care services at the primary
      level is assured to all citizens, access is limited at the secondary and tertiary levels.94
      56.    International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) stated that Slovenia should be
      urged, among others to enforce national law on the marketing of breast milk substitutes;
      and ensure integrated response to protect and support breastfeeding in case of
      emergencies.95

 8.   Right to education
      57.    The Committee of Experts on the European Charter for Regional or Minority
      Languages of the Council of Europe (CoE-CECRML) urged Slovenian authorities to:
      ensure full implementation of the “Strategy for Education of Roma in the Republic of
      Slovenia” of 2004; promote awareness and acceptance of the Romani language and culture
      as an integral part of Slovenia’s cultural wealth; and to include this promotion among the
      objectives of national education, and to encourage the mass media to pursue the same
      objective.96

 9.   Cultural rights
      58.    CoE-CM recommended identifying effective ways of improving the implementation
      of the existing legislative framework for the protection of the culture and languages of
      national minorities, with particular attention to activities aiming at preserving and
      promoting minority culture.97
      59.     CoE-CECRML urged Slovenian authorities to define, in co-operation with the
      speakers, the areas where German and Croatian have been traditionally spoken in
      Slovenia98 and CoE-CM recommended to clarify the issue of the traditional presence of the
      Bosnian language in Slovenia, develop the teaching of the Romani language and Roma
      culture at all appropriate stages, and take proactive measures to reduce the gap between the
      legislative framework and practical implementation regarding the use of Hungarian and
      Italian in public services and other spaces.99

10.   Persons with disabilities
      60.     EU-FRA referred to low levels of employment of persons with disabilities.100 EU-
      FRA also stated that in Slovenia the Constitutional Court dismissed a claim that an Act
      which sets a minimum proportion of employees with disabilities constitutes a
      disproportionate interference with employers’ freedom. EU-FRA affirmed that this decision
      illustrates a growing recognition that positive action measures may be required for the
      effective application of the principle of non-discrimination.101
      61.     OSCE/ODIHR stated that although Slovenian law provides for measures to enable
      the participation of disabled voters, these measures do not always facilitate the secrecy of
      their vote.102 OSCE/ODIHR recommended that the National Election Commission and
      other relevant authorities conduct a review to identify and adopt measures, including
      amendments to legislation if necessary, which would further facilitate access for disabled
      voters. It further recommends that such a review be inclusive of disabled voters.103




                                                                                                          9
A/HRC/WG.6/20/SVN/3


            62.    CoE-ESCR concluded in 2012 that it had not been established that the right of
            children with disabilities to mainstream training was effectively guaranteed.104

      11.   Minorities and indigenous peoples
            63.     CoE-ACFC stated that substantial improvements are needed to ensure effective
            protection against discrimination in particular, access to effective remedies for potential
            victims of discrimination and increased consultation of minority representatives in the
            allocation process of funds.105
            64.    CoE-ACFC recommended ensuring that the distinction between “autochthonous”
            and “non-autochthonous” Roma no longer results in practice in any differentiated
            treatment.106
            65.    AI affirmed that the lack of prevention of discrimination against Roma remains a
            systemic problem, due to the ineffective national human rights framework,107 CoE-ACFC
            called on Slovenian authorities to make further efforts to combat all forms of intolerance
            and racism targeting persons belonging to minorities - especially Roma -, and other groups,
            including in the political life and the media.108
            66.    AI stated that in mid-2013 representatives of the Office for National Minorities
            promised there would be no forced evictions, that individual plans would be developed and
            that outreach programmes for pre-school education and social support would start
            immediately.109 It added that by March 2014, none of these promises had been fulfilled by
            the local government.110
            67.     CoE-CM recommended as an issue for immediate action to ensure effective
            involvement of national minority representatives in discussions on any administrative
            change that could have an impact on minority protection.111 CoE-CM also recommended as
            issues for immediate action, inter alia, to ensure that Roma representatives are able to take
            part in public affairs at local level in all the municipalities in which they live in substantial
            numbers; take further steps to provide elected Roma councillors with all the support they
            need to carry out their tasks effectively; and ensure that Roma Community Council
            adequately represents the diversity within the Roma community.112 CoE-ACFC asserted
            that opportunities for Roma to take part effectively in public affairs remain insufficient both
            at local and at central level.113

      12.   Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers
            68.     EU-FRA stated that in Slovenia, third-country nationals who are issued a
            ‘permission to remain’ due to the impossibility of removal on the basis of Article 52 of the
            Aliens Act, are entitled to housing, normally in accommodation centres.114 EU-FRA said
            that in Slovenia a positive initiative is that asylum seekers are issued with the same social
            security card as the Slovenian citizens, thus facilitating access to primary health care.115
            69.    CoE-ECSR in 2011 affirmed that it had not been established that concerning
            remuneration, employment and other working conditions, the treatment of migrant workers
            was not less favourable than that of nationals nor that concerning membership of trade
            union and enjoyment of the benefits of collective bargaining. It also asserted that equal
            treatment and adequate conditions are not secured for migrant workers with respect to
            access to housing.116
            70.    EU-FRA stated that the Slovenian 2011 Aliens Act provided minimum standards on
            sanctions and measures against employers of illegally staying third-country nationals,
            including protection measures for victims of illegal employment who can now receive a
            temporary residence permit. EU-FRA stated in 2013 that the Slovenian government

            amended the local election act by lifting the current five-year minimum residence
            requirement for non-national EU citizens.
