       I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process

      A.       Presentation by the State under review

               5.     The head of the delegation informed the Human Rights Council that the national
               report had been prepared inclusively, involving government institutions, the Human Rights
               Ombudsman and civil society. The national Interministerial Commission on Human Rights
               monitored implementation of recommendations, with a voluntary midterm report submitted
               in 2022. Slovenia had fully or partially implemented 180 of the 182 recommendations from
               the previous cycle.
               6.     The human rights framework remained strong, with the Ombudsman and the
               Advocate of the Principle of Equality as independent institutions. The Office of the Human
               Rights Ombudsman had been accredited with A-status under the principles relating to the
               status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris
               Principles) in 2021. Slovenia had strengthened efforts to combat hate speech, establishing
               the Strategic Council for the Prevention of Hate Speech in 2023 and amending the Criminal
               Code to introduce a provision on hate crime. Public awareness campaigns and the upcoming
               amendments to the Media Act had further reinforced those efforts.
               7.      The Long-Term Care Act adopted in 2023 had enhanced access to care. Housing
               reforms was aimed at increasing affordable public rental units. A homelessness prevention
               strategy was set for adoption in early 2025. Gender equality advanced with nearly 40 per cent
               of parliament composed of women. Measures had been included in the National Programme


           1 A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1.
           2 A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2.
           3 A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/3.

                                                                                                              A/HRC/59/15


              for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men, while the National Programme for the
              Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women had introduced targeted
              protections. In 2021, the Criminal Code had been amended to include an affirmative consent
              model in defining rape.
              8.      Slovenia had promoted disability inclusion, amending the Constitution in 2021 to
              recognize Slovenian Sign Language and tactile sign language for deafblind persons. In 2023,
              disenfranchisement of persons under guardianship due to intellectual or psychosocial
              disabilities had been abolished. Child protection had been reinforced with the opening of the
              first Children’s House (Barnahus) in 2022. The Government continued supporting the Italian
              and Hungarian national communities and the Roma population through targeted education,
              social inclusion and improvements to living conditions.
              9.     Migration policy had progressed with an Integration Strategy in 2023 and a new
              Immigration Strategy in 2024. Legislation had been amended to safeguard migrant rights,
              and accommodation expanded for asylum-seekers. Permanent centres for unaccompanied
              minors with professional support teams had been opened in 2024. On “erased persons”
              (persons from the former Yugoslavia who had been removed from the country’s Register of
              Permanent Residents in 1992 following the independence of Slovenia in 1991), the
              Constitutional Court had upheld compensation legislation in 2024 and pending cases
              continued to be resolved.
              10.     Slovenia maintained one of the lowest rates of unimplemented judgments of the
              European Court of Human Rights due to a well-coordinated approach. In 2021, it had ratified
              the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
              A strategy to combat antisemitism had been adopted in 2023.
              11.     On international commitments, Slovenia was in the process of ratifying the
              International Labour Organization Violence and Harassment Convention, 2019 (No. 190),
              while the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
              Rights was under review. While the International Labour Organization Domestic Workers
              Convention, 2011 (No. 189), was not planned for ratification, domestic workers had equal
              rights under national law. In January 2024, the Government had submitted a draft law to
              ratify the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.

                                                                                                                A/HRC/59/15


              42.    Vanuatu recognized the commendable progress achieved by Slovenia on human rights

              43.     The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela expressed concern about labour market gender

              44.   Viet Nam commended Slovenia for its commitment to human rights through policies

              45.   Zambia noted efforts in promoting environmental rights, including new targets for
              renewable energy and emissions reduction.
              46.    The delegation of Slovenia stated that the Government had addressed prison
              overcrowding, which had been largely due to illegal border crossings and a shortage of
              judicial police officers, by transferring inmates, granting conditional and early releases, and
              providing a legal basis for enacting temporary measures. Two temporary measures had been
              activated in October 2024. A new prison in Ljubljana, due to be finalized in 2025, was
              expected to ease overcrowding and provide inclusive facilities. Alternative sanctions,
              including weekend jail, house arrest and community service, had also been promoted.
              47.    Slovenia emphasized that hate speech and hate crime harmed individuals and society.
              In 2023, the Criminal Code had been amended to make bias motivation an obligatory
              aggravating circumstance in sentencing. In the prosecution policy of 2024, the State
              Prosecutor General had prioritized hate speech-related offences, which were also a key focus
              of the National Programme of Crime Prevention and Suppression. The Strategic Council for
              the Prevention of Hate Speech, established in 2023, collaborated with non-governmental
              organizations, experts and State bodies.
              48.    Since 2019, victims’ rights had been reinforced, ensuring access to information and
              individualized assessments. The efforts of the police and judiciary had improved victim
              support, with victim support services established in the two largest district courts and plans
              for expansion. Training for professionals covered gender-based violence, child protection,
              and domestic abuse.
              49.    Amendments to the Human Rights Ombudsman Act, drafted in 2023, aimed to expand
              its mandate to monitor State actions against trafficking in persons and oversee public
              services. The proposal included establishing a child rights ombudsman, who might also be
              granted the power to monitor implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons
              with Disabilities. The new ombudsman was expected to take office in 2025. The budget of
              the Human Rights Ombudsman had steadily increased and was submitted directly to the
              National Assembly following a ruling in 2020 by the Constitutional Court.
              50.    Slovenia prioritized gender equality. The National Programme for Equal
              Opportunities for Women and Men addressed gender mainstreaming, intersectionality and
              discrimination. Slovenia had one of the lowest gender pay gaps in the European Union, at
              4.5 percentage points, and was developing a pay gap information tool, with planned
              awareness campaigns and employer training.
              51.    Amendments introduced in 2023 required publicly listed companies to ensure at least
              40 per cent gender representation on supervisory boards by 2026. Efforts to combat domestic
              and gender-based violence included expanding crisis accommodation and shelters, with
              placements increasing by 10.5 per cent since 2019. The Love Does (Not) Hurt campaign,
              launched in 2023, raised awareness through public figures and social media. The Criminal
              Code was being amended to allow ex officio prosecution of marital rape and sexual violence.
              52.     Slovenia reaffirmed its commitment to disability rights. The Action Programme for
              Persons with Disabilities addressed diverse needs, and a research project on violence against
              women with disabilities aimed to improve data collection. Accessibility regulations required
              all public buildings to be fully accessible by 2025, and a national information centre had been
              established in 2024. Deinstitutionalization efforts continued, relocating residents to
              community-based housing. Since 2019, individuals with disabilities had a legal right to
              personal assistance.

              53.     The Programme for Children covered key areas of child welfare, with more than
              €500 million having been allocated in 2024. Slovenia had one of the lowest child poverty
              rates in the European Union, with 9.3 per cent of children at risk of social exclusion. The
              Child Guarantee National Action Plan ensured equal access to education, healthcare,
              nutrition and housing for at-risk children.
              54.    The anti-discrimination framework protected individuals regardless of their sexual
              orientation or gender identity. Amendments to the Family Code had redefined marriage as a
              union between two persons, granting same-sex couples equal adoption rights. A national
              strategy to promote LGBTQ+ rights and eliminate discrimination was in progress.
              55.    Slovenia remained committed to protecting older persons, given the demographic
              trends of an ageing population. The Long-Term Care Act had established an accessible public
              care system focused on individual choice and expanding community-based support.
              Measures were in place to prevent violence against older persons, including training and
              research initiatives.
              56.     Slovenia continued efforts to protect Roma rights. The National Programme of
              Measures for Roma remained the main policy framework, with combating anti-Gypsyism as
              a key priority. Awareness campaigns and school-based initiatives addressed discrimination
              and early or forced marriages. Social inclusion focused on education, employment, healthcare
              and public services. Roma enrolment in schools had increased, supported by additional
              staffing and language programmes. The National Programme for Language Policy promoted
              the Roma language, while employment initiatives improved training and job opportunities.

              Healthcare until 2031 to ensure an accessible, fair and sustainable healthcare system,
              supported by the National Mental Health Programme 2018–2028. Universal healthcare was
              guaranteed through mandatory health insurance. To address waiting times, the Government
              had expanded medical training and introduced new regulations to improve access to specialist
              care. Fifteen new outpatient clinics had been opened to strengthen primary care, and
              measures had been implemented to increase initial medical examinations and reduce waiting
              times, acknowledging the strain delays placed on patients and the healthcare system.

A/HRC/59/15


              92.    Slovenia had addressed constitutional shortcomings regarding the Mental Health Act,
              as identified by the Constitutional Court in 2015 and 2019. Amendments adopted in 2023
              had clarified admission conditions for secure social welfare institutions, ensuring both
              security and appropriate therapeutic services. The Government was committed to ongoing
              monitoring of those regulations and was preparing further amendments to expand
              community-based services and reduce involuntary treatment.
              93.    A new immigration strategy had been adopted in 2024, focusing on safe and legal
              migration, protecting dignity and preventing exploitation and hate speech. The Integration
              Strategy introduced in 2023 prioritized linguistic, educational and labour market integration,
              particularly for vulnerable groups, such as migrant women. A new language course for
              beginners, introduced in 2024, had enrolled 995 participants, most of whom were women.
              94.    Slovenia upheld international protection and the principle of non-refoulement.
              However, it faced a sharp increase in irregular border crossings, with more than 100,000 in
              2023 and 2024, 95 per cent of whom had sought asylum. The Ministry of the Interior had
              issued guidelines to ensure the humane treatment of vulnerable migrants, including families
              and unaccompanied minors. Overcrowding in 2022 and 2023 had led the Government to
              expand capacity for housing asylum-seekers and open two new centres in 2024, ensuring
              access to accommodation, food and basic necessities.
              95.    Since 2021, asylum-seekers had been allowed to leave reception centres before
              making formal applications. Detention remained strictly regulated on the basis of individual
              assessments and subject to legal remedies. Special attention was given to vulnerable
              individuals, including unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking. Under the European
              Union Pact on Migration and Asylum, Slovenia had strengthened its capacity to identify
              vulnerable individuals, upgraded legal guardianship and enhanced staff training. A legal
              framework introduced in 2023 provided for the systematic provision of accommodation and
              24-hour support for unaccompanied minors, including psychological assistance and
              education.
              96.    Slovenia had reinforced efforts to combat trafficking in persons through two-year
              action plans, awareness campaigns and professional training, with guidelines issued for
              employers and labour inspectors to prevent forced labour. Specialized police units
              collaborated with international partners on cross-border investigations, resulting in five
              convictions in 2024, with further cases ongoing.
              97.    In 2024, Slovenia had proposed a new media law to protect freedom of expression,
              improve protections for journalists and combat hate speech. While existing laws banned
              incitement to violence and hatred, enforcement remained weak due to a lack of sanctions.
              The new law had extended those prohibitions to digital media, including online influencers,
              and introduced penalties. Additional measures included State support for quality journalism
              and media literacy programmes and new rules for government advertising.
              98.    The Government had also issued guidelines for moderating discussions on public
              social networks and launched awareness campaigns to tackle online hate speech. In
              education, protocols for addressing peer violence had been updated to explicitly recognize
              online abuse. The National Assembly had passed an act on the cultural rights of ethnic
              communities of the former Yugoslavia, ensuring protections for language, media content and
              cultural heritage. Dialogue with the German-speaking ethnic group continued.
              99.    Slovenia remained committed to climate action and environmental protection, with
              the right to a clean environment enshrined in its Constitution. Significant progress had been
              made in rehabilitating damaged areas, and a third version of the Environmental Protection
              Act was being prepared to introduce further improvements.
              100. As part of its just transition strategy, Slovenia had committed to phasing out coal by
              2033. Recognizing climate change as a global security challenge, it actively participated in
              international climate discussions. The Government aimed for climate neutrality by 2050 and
              was exploring ways to accelerate achieving that goal. The first national law on climate was
              in its final coordination phase (before government approval) and would provide a legal
              framework for stronger climate action.

              101. Slovenia had increased climate financing by 40 per cent in 2023, fulfilling its
              commitment to double funding for adaptation measures. It pledged a 150 per cent increase in
              contributions to the Green Climate Fund and supported the establishment of the Fund for

              discriminatory attitudes and prejudice against LGBTIQ+ persons.
              108. Israel expressed concern about the increase in antisemitic incidents in Slovenia,
              especially since 7 October 2023.
              109. Italy welcomed the adoption of the resolution on the National Programme for the
              Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women.
              110.   Japan welcomed the positive steps taken by Slovenia since its previous review.

              118. Malaysia acknowledged the commitment of Slovenia to combating and criminalizing
              hate speech and urged it to implement related measures without bias.
              119. Maldives commended Slovenia for its ratification of the International Convention for
              the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.
              120. Malta highlighted the commitment of Slovenia to the equality of lesbian, gay,
              bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and considered it necessary to further address the
              issue of “erased” persons.
              121. Mauritius welcomed the contribution of Slovenia to the Voluntary Technical
              Assistance Trust Fund to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small
              Island Developing States in the Work of the Human Rights Council.
              122. Mexico recognized progress in reducing child poverty and the legal recognition of

              123. Montenegro commended Slovenia for its measures to promote equality and combat
              hate speech, and protect older persons, women and girls.

A/HRC/59/15


              124. Morocco welcomed the determination of Slovenia to fight hate speech and
              discrimination through legal, policy and institutional measures.
              125. Nepal commended the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman for having been
              accredited with A status, and Slovenia for its performance on child poverty reduction and
              equal opportunities for women and men.
              126. The Kingdom of the Netherlands applauded Slovenia on strengthening the rule of law
              and efforts to guarantee the rights to information and freedom of expression.
              127. Nigeria commended efforts to combat trafficking in persons and protect the rights of
              migrants.
              128.   Yemen commended Slovenia for its efforts to promote human rights.
              129. Slovenia reaffirmed its constitutional commitment to non-discrimination, ensuring
              equal rights for all. The Protection against Discrimination Act and other legislation, including
              Protocol No. 12 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental
              Freedoms (European Convention on Human Rights), provided strong safeguards. While there
              was no single anti-discrimination strategy, measures were integrated into policies on gender
              equality, antisemitism, disability rights, child protection, migration and Roma inclusion. A
              national LGBTQ+ equality strategy was being prepared, with efforts focused on promoting
              tolerance and diversity in education and training for professionals in law enforcement, social
              services and the media.
              130. Slovenia acknowledged a shortage of 15,000 public rental homes and was committed
              to investing €100 million annually in housing projects until 2035. The Family Code
              prohibited marriage under 18, with rare exceptions for those aged 15 or older deemed
              sufficiently mature, requiring court approval based on input from the minor, their intended
              spouse, parents and social workers. Since April 2019, only four underage marriage cases had
              been adjudicated.
              131. Slovenia was preparing legislation on strategic lawsuits against public participation to
              protect journalists and human rights defenders. The Government strongly supported
              Directive (EU) 2024/1069 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 April 2024
              on protecting persons who engage in public participation from manifestly unfounded claims
              or abusive court proceedings (“Strategic lawsuits against public participation”). The draft law
              being prepared had undergone public consultation in December 2024 and was expected to
              exceed the scope of the European Union Directive.
              132. In early 2025, the Government had adopted a new resolution on preventing corruption
              and submitted it to the National Assembly for approval. The independent Commission for
              the Prevention of Corruption issued recommendations, imposed fines for minor offences and
              reported annually to the National Assembly.
              133. Slovenia maintained a well-organized reproductive healthcare system, with low
              maternal mortality and an adolescent birth rate of 3.5 per cent in 2023. Every woman had
              access to affordable sexual and reproductive healthcare, and transgender individuals had
              equal access to health services. The Mental Health Act specified that mental disorders alone
              were not a valid reason for sterilization or termination of pregnancy. Public healthcare
              provided family planning services through primary, secondary and tertiary reproductive
              health teams.
              134. On women’s employment, Slovenia had seen steady progress, with the employment
              rate for women aged 20–64 rising from 72.9 per cent in 2019 to 74.3 per cent in 2023.
              Unemployment stood at 3.7 per cent, with near gender parity. Amendments to the
              Employment Relationships Act in 2023 had incorporated Directive (EU) 2019/1158 of the
              European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on work-life balance for parents
              and carers, introducing five days of unpaid family caregiving leave and the right to
              disconnect, ensuring worker protections and gender equality in the labour market.
              135. Slovenia had addressed gender reassignment by allowing registration based on a
              medical attestation. Individuals received a new personal identification number and their birth
              certificate reflected the new gender without noting the reassignment.

                                                                                                                  A/HRC/59/15


              136. Defamation remained a criminal offence but was prosecuted by the victim, in a similar
              fashion to civil cases. Courts could reduce sentences if the accused apologized or retracted
              their statements. Penalties for criminal offences against honour and reputation were low,
              typically three to six months of imprisonment, with higher sentences for severe cases. The
              Constitutional Court had confirmed that such criminal legislation was compatible with the
              Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.
              137. Slovenia continued to introduce reforms to the juvenile justice system. Although a
              draft bill on juvenile offenders had been prepared in 2019, legislative challenges had delayed
              its adoption. A comprehensive analysis had been conducted with European Union technical
              assistance, leading to a new draft bill that had been submitted for public consultation in
              January 2025. Meanwhile, amendments to the Criminal Procedure Act in 2020 and 2024 had
              improved protections for minors during criminal proceedings.
              138. Slovenia reaffirmed its commitment to human rights at the national and international
              levels, viewing them as central to sustainable development, peace and stability. Slovenia
              prioritized gender equality, the rights of women and girls, children and older persons,
              environmental protection, human rights education and minority rights, which would remain
              key in its foreign policy.
              139. The Government pledged to carefully review recommendations from the review
              process, engaging ministries, government agencies, national human rights institutions and
              civil society in the follow-up. The delegation expressed its appreciation to all those
              delegations that had participated in the review, the secretariat, interpreters and the troika for
              their contributions.
