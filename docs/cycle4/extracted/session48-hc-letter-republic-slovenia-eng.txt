Madam,


            I have the honour             to refer to the fourth          cycle    review       of Slovenia        by the Universal
Periodic       Review         (UPR)     Working        Group       at its 48Ih session in January                2025. As the final
outcome        report     on the review           of Slovenia        was recently         adopted     by the Human            Rights
Council      at its     59'h session, I have taken note of the efforts of your Government                                        to
implement        specific       recommendations              since the previous            revievv.


            A matrix       of thematically            c'justered     recommendations,             starting      with     those
supported       by your Government,                   is available     at OHCHR's           website

this letter.    The matrix            indicates      the recommending             State and links            each recommendation
to relevant      Sustainable           Development          Goals     (SDGs).


            In annex,         I have also attached          my Office's          observations         in light     of the outcome
of the fourth         cycle    of the UPR.           In line with     previous      practice,       I will    be sending         similar
observations          to all Member          States once their          fourth     cycle UPR          outcome       is adopted             by
the Human        Rights        Council,      with     a view    to follow-up        action      in close cooperation                  with
national     entities     and other        stakeholders.


            I take this opportunity               to draw your        attention     to the support           available     tmough               the

guidance'5      and the "{JN            good practices"         repository        on how the UPR process                   supports
sustainable      development,             available      at https://www.ohchr.org/en/hr-bodies/upr/upr-main,
with   a view     to facilitating          efforts     to implement          UPR recornrnendations                in line with             the
SDGs.


           Please accept,          Madam,         the assurances         of my highest          consideration.

                             Observations                  in light           of the      outcome           of the fourth                  cycle       of
                                                           the Universal                  Periodic          Review


               Slovenia's             ratification               of the International                    Convention                 for      the Protection                   of All
Persons          from        Enforced            Disappearance                    and its accession                   to the 1961                 Convention                 on the
Reduction            of Statelessness                   are welcome.                  The accreditation                  with         A status           of the Office                of
the     Human            Rights          Ombudsman                       by     the       Global         Alliance           of     National               Human              Rights
Instit'utions          represents              a significant              step forward.


               Positive         note        is also        taken         of the fact           that      Slovenia           maintains              one of the lowest
rates     of unimplemented                       judgments                 of the European                   Court       of Human                  Rights.            It is to be
commended               that     Slovenia             ranks            among       the countries               with     the lowest                child     poverty               rates
in the European                 Union.


               Taking         into     account             concerns            raised      during        the review,             Slovenia            is encouraged                    to
intensify           measures           to combat                 all     forms        of discrimination,                    with       particular            emphasis                on
combating              hate    speech           and racist               and xenophobic                  rhetoric           against          minorities,              including
through          the     National              Programme                  of     Crime         Prevention              and         Suppression                   2024-2028,
which       established              addressing             hate speech               as a key priority.               Slovenia              is also invited                 to take
effective           measures            to     safeguard                the     independence                 and       freedom               of    the      press,           and      to
strengthen             the    protection              of journalists                  and      other      media          professionals,                   particularly                in
response         to threats           and instances                    of sexual         abuse targeting               female          journalists,              both        online
and offline.


               As     raised         during          the    UPR           process,          Slovenia            is encouraged                     to continue                taking
coricrete        and targeted                actions        to reduce            poverty           and inequalities                 within         society,           including
by      improving              access           to    health             services           and       mainstreaming                      education               to    promote
inclusivity,           ensuring             inclusion             and      equitable           access          to basic          services           for     persons               with
disabilities,           and protecting                  the rights              of minorities               and       ensuring            their      social           inclusion,
with     particular           attention          to the situation                  of Roma             communities.                   Slovenia           is also urged                to
continue            strengthening               its     support           for     refugees            and      migrants,              ensuring            that        they        have
access      to adequate              protection,                social        integration          programmes                and other             essential           services,
such     as healthcare,               education             and employment.


               Slovenia         is encouraged                     to develop               an implementation                       plan        in follow              up to the
UPR      outcome,             in close          consultation                  and cooperation                  with      all stakeholders,                   in particular
the     parliament,             the        judiciary,              the         Human           Rights          Ombudsman,                      local        and         regional
governrnents,                 and      civil         society            organizations.                The       matrix           of       thematically                 clustered
recommendations                      may       be of use in the development                                 of such an implementation                                 plan.        The
Government              is encouraged                  to explicitly              link     each UPR             recommendation                       to corresponding
recommendations                      from       other       international                 and regional            human            rights         mechanisms                  and to
the relevant            SDG          and its targets.                    This     will,      in tum,           facilitate          the      creation         of synergies
between          UPR         implementation                     and SDG-related                     actions        and reporting                   within        the context
of the Voluntary                National              Review            (VNR).           Due      note      has been taken                   of the announcement
made        by        the      delegation                  of      Slovenia               during         the      review              that        follow-up                  to     the

recommendations                 will      be     ensured         in     full      coordination                 with     all    ministries       and
governmental            institutions,          and in dialogue                 with      the Human             Rights         Ombudsman,         the
Advocate          of the Principle        of Equality,          and humanrights                  non-governrnental               organizations.
As mentioned           by the delegation               during     the review,              the Internninisterial               Commission,        for
Human        Rights      placed        the revievv       of implementation                      of UPR          recommendations              on its
agenda as a standing              item.


            The Government                is further     encouraged               to further            strengthen      the Interministenal
Commission             on Human           Rights,      with     the aim           of ensuring             a coordinated            and effective
approach         to reporting      to international           human        rights        mechanisms,             and to implementing             the
recommendations,                in line     with     the guidance               provided           by OHCHR              following       regional
consultations          and      the     High       Cornrnissioner's                   report       to    the    Human          Rights     Council
( A/HRC/50/64).


            Further,     an important           measure       that could              positively        contribute      to follow-up         action
is voluntary         mid-term          UPR      reporting.       All     Member                States     are encouraged             to submit        a
voluntary        mid-term        UPR report          about two          years after the adoption                      of the UPR        outcome.
In this regard,        due note is taken of the announcement                                   made by the delegation                of Slovenia
