Human Rights Council
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review
Forty-eighth session
Geneva, 20–31 January 2025


            Slovenia

            Compilation of information prepared by the Office of the
            United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights

       I.   Background
            1.     The present report was prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1
            and 16/21, taking into consideration the outcome of the previous review.1 It is a compilation
            of information contained in relevant United Nations documents, presented in a summarized
            manner owing to word-limit constraints.


      II.   Scope of international obligations and cooperation with
            human rights mechanisms
            2.      The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women welcomed the
            ratification by Slovenia of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons
            from Enforced Disappearance, in 2021.2
            3.     The same Committee encouraged Slovenia to ratify the International Convention on
            the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.3
            4.      The Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the
            enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment encouraged Slovenia to
            ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
            Rights.4
            5.     The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
            welcomed the Government’s pledge to accede to the Convention on the Reduction of
            Statelessness, announced during the 2023 Global Refugee Forum, and recommended
            acceding to the Convention.5
            6.    The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
            recommended ratifying the Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications
            concerning Higher Education.6
            7.      Slovenia made annual financial contributions to the Office of the United Nations High
            Commissioner for Human Rights, including the Voluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund
            to Support the Participation of Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing
            States in the Work of the Human Rights Council.7

    III.    National human rights framework
            Institutional infrastructure and policy measures
            8.     The Committee against Torture commended Slovenia for the accreditation of the
            Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman with A status by the Global Alliance of National
            Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), in 2021. 8 The GANHRI Subcommittee on
            Accreditation encouraged the Office of the Ombudsman to advocate for the funding
            necessary to effectively carry out the full breadth of its mandate and for appropriate
            modifications to applicable administrative procedures to ensure that its independence and
            financial autonomy were guaranteed.9
            9.      The Special Rapporteur on environment stated that Slovenia should consider the
            establishment of a special ombudsperson for the rights of children, as many other nations in
            Europe and elsewhere had done.10
            10.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with
            concern the absence of mechanisms to ensure compliance with the recommendations of the
            Advocate of the Principle of Equality. The Committee recommended that Slovenia provide
            the Advocate of the Principle of Equality with the authority to issue binding rulings and
            impose sanctions for gender-based discrimination, and allocate adequate human, technical
            and financial resources for its effective functioning.11


    IV.     Promotion and protection of human rights

      A.    Implementation of international human rights obligations, taking into
            account applicable international humanitarian law

       1.   Right to life, liberty and security of person, and freedom from torture
            11.     The Committee against Torture requested Slovenia to review its legislation to ensure
            that there was no gap between the definition in article 135 (a) of the Criminal Code and the
            definition in article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
            Degrading Treatment or Punishment and that the minimum penalties for acts of torture were
            commensurate with the grave nature of the crime, as set out in article 4 (2) of the
            Convention.12
            12.     The same Committee expressed regret that the offence of torture was subject to a
            statute of limitations in cases in which it did not qualify as a crime against humanity or a war
            crime. The Committee requested Slovenia to seek to adopt the legislative measures necessary
            to ensure that the offence of torture was not subject to any statute of limitations, even in cases
            in which it did not qualify as a crime against humanity or a war crime.13
            13.     The same Committee stated that Slovenia should ensure that, in law and in practice,
            all victims of torture and ill-treatment, including victims of trafficking and gender-based
            violence, obtained redress, including by ensuring an enforceable right to fair and adequate
            compensation and the means for as full a rehabilitation as possible.14
            14.    The same Committee recommended that Slovenia redouble its efforts to ease
            overcrowding in detention centres, in particular by making greater use of non-custodial
            measures, continue to improve existing prison facilities and material conditions and ensure
            that conditions and treatment in all places of detention, including the new Ljubljana prison,
            were fully in line with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of
            Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) and the European Prison Rules adopted by the Council
            of Europe.15
            15.    The same Committee recommended that Slovenia take specific measures to provide
            older persons and persons with disabilities with individualized reasonable accommodation
            and accessible facilities in prisons and continue improving the quality of the health services
            provided to detainees.16



2                                                                                                                GE.24-19779
                                                                                                     A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


              16.      The same Committee expressed its appreciation for the wide monitoring mandate of
              the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman in its capacity as the national preventive
              mechanism and stated that Slovenia should continue its efforts to maintain a dialogue with
              the national preventive mechanism and carefully consider all outstanding recommendations
              that it had made.17

        2.    Administration of justice, including impunity, and the rule of law
              17.     The Committee against Torture noted with concern reports that access to free legal
              aid, which should be provided from the very outset of deprivation of liberty, was in practice
              provided only prior to the court hearing and after police questioning. The Committee stated
              that Slovenia should ensure that all detained persons from the very outset of their deprivation
              of liberty had unimpeded access to an independent lawyer of their choice or, if necessary, to
              free legal aid, including during the initial interrogation and inquiry.18
              18.    The same Committee was concerned that access to ex officio lawyers was not always
              assured for minors facing criminal charges for offences that carried sentences of less than
              three years of deprivation of liberty, as it was subject to the decision of a juvenile judge. The
              Committee stated that Slovenia should ensure that all minors facing criminal charges were
              represented by either a lawyer of their choice or an ex officio lawyer and that adequate
              conditions of detention were maintained in juvenile reform schools, in line with the United
              Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty.19
              19.    The same Committee stated that Slovenia should ensure that solitary confinement was
              used only in exceptional cases as a last resort, for as short a time as possible (but no more
              than 15 consecutive days), subject to independent review and only pursuant to authorization
              by a competent authority, and that instances of solitary confinement were properly registered
              and documented. The Committee also stated that Slovenia should respect the prohibition of
              the imposition of solitary confinement and similar measures on minors.20

        3.    Fundamental freedoms
              20.    UNESCO noted that defamation continued to be a criminal offence under articles 160
              and 161 of the Criminal Code, carrying a maximum penalty of one year in prison. UNESCO
              recommended that the Government decriminalize defamation and place it within a civil code
              in accordance with international standards.21

        4.    Prohibition of all forms of slavery, including trafficking in persons
              21.     The International Organization for Migration (IOM) noted that Slovenia was a transit
              country and a country of destination for victims of trafficking in persons.22 The Committee
              of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International
              Labour Organization (ILO) noted the adoption of the Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in
              Human Beings and of the guidelines for labour inspectors on identifying victims of
              trafficking in persons.23
              22.     The Committee against Torture stated that Slovenia should intensify its efforts to
              prevent and combat trafficking in persons, including by strengthening the procedure for the
              early identification and referral of victims among persons in vulnerable circumstances, such
              as asylum-seekers and migrants, including unaccompanied minors, and by providing
              specialized assistance to children who were victims of trafficking, including adequate
              accommodation in facilities adapted to their specific needs. The Committee also stated that
              Slovenia should continue strengthening the regular mandatory training on early identification
              and referral of victims of trafficking to the appropriate services that was provided to
              immigration and law enforcement officers.24
              23.      IOM recommended that Slovenia address the absence of specialized assistance for
              children who were victims of trafficking by establishing specialized accommodation
              facilities.25
              24.     The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with
              concern the low number of investigations, prosecutions and convictions in cases of
              trafficking in persons. The Committee recommended that Slovenia strengthen the criminal


GE.24-19779                                                                                                            3
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


            justice response to trafficking in persons, ensure that all cases of trafficking were prosecuted
            and traffickers adequately punished and establish an independent mechanism for monitoring
            and evaluating the implementation of its anti-trafficking legislation and policies.26

       5.   Right to work and to just and favourable conditions of work
            25.   The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with
            concern the persistence of gender segregation in the labour market. The Committee
            recommended that Slovenia take targeted measures, such as financial incentives for
            employers, to promote the equal participation of women in the labour market, in particular in
            innovative sectors such as the digital sector.27
            26.     The ILO Committee of Experts noted the 2019 Eurostat figures indicating that the
            gender pay gap was 8 per cent, based on average gross hourly earnings. It noted with concern
            that the gender pay gap had been progressively widening over the previous 10 years.28 The
            Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women welcomed the reduction of
            the gender pay gap to 3.1 points. However, the Committee noted with concern the significant
            salary difference between men and women of the same level of education, in the public and
            the private sectors, and the low remuneration of women employed in the care sector and
            women with disabilities. The Committee recommended enforcing the principle of equal pay
            for work of equal value in order to narrow and ultimately close the gender pay gap, including
            by undertaking regular gender pay reviews in all occupational sectors, including the public
            service, in cooperation with employers’ associations and trade unions, applying
            gender-sensitive analytical job classification and evaluation methods.29

       6.   Right to social security
            27.    In 2023, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported a reduction of more
            than 30 per cent in the child income poverty rate in Slovenia. UNICEF concluded that, for
            Slovenia, the key to success had been improving living standards, in part promoted by labour
            market policies, noting that, in the decade since the financial crisis of 2008, the Government
            had implemented a series of policies to tackle in-work poverty and promote decent work.30

       7.   Right to an adequate standard of living
            28.     The Special Rapporteur on environment stated that the Government should ensure
            safe, sufficient water and adequate sanitation, including by earmarking revenues from water
            tariffs to fund the renewal of water supply and sanitation infrastructure and by taking
            immediate action to connect all Roma settlements that remained unserved to local drinking
            water and sanitation infrastructure.31
            29.    The same Special Rapporteur stated that the Government should take steps to advance
            healthy and sustainably produced food, including by promoting agroecology and organic,
            regenerative and other ecologically sustainable food production systems, reducing food waste
            and promoting predominantly plant-based diets.32

       8.   Right to health
            30.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with
            concern the low level of preventive care for the most frequent and fastest growing diseases
            and conditions, such as high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes and sexually transmitted
            diseases. The Committee recommended strengthening the implementation, monitoring and
            evaluation of preventive health-care programmes.33
            31.    The same Committee noted with concern the limited access to health services for
            disadvantaged groups of women, including women with disabilities. The Committee also
            noted with concern the poor health status of Roma women, due in part to socioeconomic
            factors, such as unhealthy living conditions, low levels of education and poverty. The
            Committee recommended ensuring that women and girls belonging to disadvantaged groups,
            such as women and girls with disabilities, had affordable access to healthcare, including
            sexual and reproductive health services.34




4                                                                                                              GE.24-19779
                                                                                                    A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


              32.    The same Committee noted with concern the lack of education on sexual and
              reproductive health and rights, including responsible sexual behaviour, in school curricula at
              all levels of education. The Committee recommended that Slovenia integrate
              gender-responsive, age-appropriate and accessible education on sexual and reproductive
              health and rights, including responsible sexual behaviour, modern contraceptives and
              prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, into school curricula at all levels of education,
              and provide systematic training to teachers. The Committee also recommended that Slovenia
              take targeted measures, including age-appropriate sexuality education and free access to
              modern contraceptives and family planning services, to prevent early pregnancy among
              Roma girls.35

        9.    Right to education
              33.    UNESCO stated that Slovenia should be encouraged to enshrine the right to education
              in the Constitution and guarantee in legislation the right to education for everyone and at
              every level of education and at least 12 years of free primary and secondary education.
              UNESCO also stated that Slovenia should be encouraged to introduce legislation to make
              pre-primary education free and compulsory for at least one year.36
              34.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with
              concern the low enrolment rates of girls with disabilities in mainstream education. The
              Committee recommended strengthening access for women and girls with disabilities to
              inclusive education at all levels.37

       10.    Cultural rights
              35.     UNESCO stated that, as a party to the Convention for the Protection of the World
              Cultural and Natural Heritage, the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural
              Heritage and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural
              Expressions, Slovenia was encouraged to fully implement the provisions of those instruments
              that promoted access to and participation in cultural heritage and creative expressions and,
              as such, were conducive to realizing the right to take part in cultural life. UNESCO also stated
              that, in doing so, Slovenia was encouraged to give due consideration to the participation of
              communities, practitioners, cultural actors and civil society organizations, as well as
              non-governmental organizations representing vulnerable groups (minorities, migrants,
              refugees, young people and persons with disabilities), and to ensure that equal opportunities
              were given to women and girls to address gender disparities.38

       11.    Development, the environment, and business and human rights
              36.    The Special Rapporteur on environment stated that Slovenia should increase spending
              on environmental protection to improve the implementation and enforcement of
              environmental laws and policies, thus ensuring that all persons enjoyed their right to a healthy
              environment. Environmental tax revenues in 2021 were approximately 10 times government
              spending on environmental protection, thus offering an obvious source of revenue to be
              dedicated to environmental programmes.39
              37.     The same Special Rapporteur urged the Government to apply a rights-based approach
              to all climate and environmental action, ensuring the protection of vulnerable and
              marginalized individuals and communities. The Special Rapporteur stated that, in particular,
              the Government should accelerate plans to close down the coal-fired power plant and
              electrify end uses of energy, including heating, cooling and transportation.40
              38.     The same Special Rapporteur stated that the Government should protect and improve
              air quality, including by reducing emissions from motor vehicles and accelerating plans to
              close the coal-fired power plant; subsidizing the replacement of heating sources using wood,
              coal or other fuels with electric heat pumps, prioritizing the needs of households facing
              energy poverty; and reducing emissions from industrial pollution hotspots.41
              39.    The same Special Rapporteur also stated that the Government should further improve
              solid waste management and safely manage toxic substances, including by systematically
              applying extended producer responsibility in the context of solid waste management so that
              producers of paper, plastic, packaging, batteries, tyres and other materials became

GE.24-19779                                                                                                           5
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


            responsible for financing and operating an effective recycling programme, thus reducing
            government costs, and moving towards a circular economy.42
            40.     The same Special Rapporteur further stated that the Government should protect and
            restore healthy ecosystems and biodiversity, including by ensuring that there were sufficient
            resources, strong rules and management plans for effectively and equitably managing human
            activities in protected areas.43
            41.    The same Special Rapporteur stated that the Government should take steps to improve
            access to information, strengthen public participation and facilitate access to justice in
            environmental matters, including by establishing a national strategy on human rights
            defenders where the specific risks and protection needs of environmental human rights
            defenders were recognized and taken into consideration.44
            42.    The same Special Rapporteur noted that Slovenia had unveiled its first National
            Action Plan on Business and Human Rights in 2018 and that an updated version had been
            published in 2021.45


      B.    Rights of specific persons or groups

       1.   Women
            43.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
            adopting a comprehensive gender equality strategy involving all components of society and
            engaging women’s organizations in its design, implementation and evaluation.46
            44.     The same Committee noted with concern the unbalanced gender representation in
            political and public life, with women accounting for only 13.6 per cent of mayors; 35 per
            cent of municipal and city councillors; 20 per cent of Roma councillors; 27.7 per cent of chief
            executive officers; 24.6 per cent of executive directors of the largest listed companies; and
            27.7 per cent of chairpersons, members of the boards and employee representatives. The
            Committee also noted with concern the lack of measures to promote the political participation
            of women and support women candidates campaigning for election.47
            45.    The same Committee recommended that Slovenia amend the Law on Elections to the
            National Assembly with a view to achieving gender parity on lists of political party
            candidates, ensuring a minimum 40 per cent quota for women, and amend the Companies
            Act to require boards of large and medium-sized listed companies and autonomous public
            companies to ensure equal representation of women and men on their boards.48
            46.    The same Committee also recommended that Slovenia adopt temporary special
            measures to accelerate women’s equal participation in all areas covered by the Convention
            on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and at all levels where
            women were underrepresented or disadvantaged, in particular in political and public life, and
            ensure that such measures remained in force until their objectives had been achieved and
            sustained for a period of time.49
            47.    The same Committee further recommended that Slovenia adopt targeted measures for
            the economic empowerment of women, address the risk of the feminization of poverty and
            mainstream gender into its social inclusion strategies, with particular attention paid to
            disadvantaged groups of women such as single mothers and older women.50
            48.    The same Committee recommended developing and strengthening programmes to
            support women entrepreneurs, such as business start-up programmes, low interest credit
            schemes, entrepreneurship support funds, special tax policies and support activities provided
            by financial banks.51
            49.   The Committee against Torture noted with concern the persistently high incidence of
            domestic violence, which had increased significantly during the coronavirus disease
            (COVID-19) pandemic, and the low rate of prosecutions and convictions in that context.52
            50.   The same Committee commended Slovenia for the adoption of the Domestic Violence
            Action Plan 2023–2024. 53 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
            Women noted the various strategies developed in the area of violence against women.


6                                                                                                             GE.24-19779
                                                                                                     A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


              However, the Committee noted with concern the absence of a comprehensive strategy on
              gender-based violence against women and of a permanent mechanism to coordinate, monitor
              and assess the effectiveness of measures taken to address violence against women. The
              Committee recommended adopting a comprehensive strategy to combat all forms of
              gender-based violence against women and allocating adequate funding for its
              implementation, regular monitoring and evaluation.54
              51.     The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
              establishing a permanent mechanism to coordinate, monitor and assess the effectiveness of
              the measures taken to address gender-based violence against women and providing it with
              adequate human, technical and financial resources.55
              52.    The same Committee recommended establishing sexual violence referral centres,
              providing adequate shelters for victims of gender-based violence in all regions and ensuring
              that they met the accommodation needs of all women who were victims of violence,
              including women with disabilities.56
              53.     The Committee against Torture expressed concern about the lack of ex officio
              investigations into cases of marital rape and sexual violence against a spouse or partner, since,
              pursuant to the Criminal Code, prosecution for those acts could be initiated only upon a
              complaint from a victim. 57 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
              Women noted with concern that sentences for perpetrators of gender-based violence were
              often lenient and not commensurate with the gravity of the crimes.58
              54.    The Committee against Torture stated that Slovenia should review the legislation
              applicable to offences of marital rape and sexual violence against a spouse or partner and the
              rules concerning ex officio prosecution, so as not to exclude the initiation of cases in the
              absence of a formal complaint by the victim and to afford the broadest protection possible to
              victims and others at risk of victimization. 59 The Committee on the Elimination of
              Discrimination against Women recommended ensuring that sentences in cases of
              gender-based violence against women were commensurate with the gravity of the harm
              suffered.60
              55.     The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
              that Slovenia ensure the effective enforcement and monitoring of protection orders, including
              restraining and separation orders, and impose adequate penalties for non-compliance.61
              56.    The Committee against Torture stated that Slovenia should strengthen the training
              provided to law enforcement officials, judges, medical professionals and other relevant
              professionals, in particular on the forms and consequences of domestic violence and on
              gender-responsive techniques to interview and accompany the victims of gender-based
              violence.62
              57.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women stated that
              redress for victims should include, as appropriate, restitution (reinstatement), compensation
              (whether provided in the form of money, goods or services) and rehabilitation (medical
              treatment, psychosocial counselling and social services).63

        2.    Children
              58.     The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with
              concern that the legislation of Slovenia provided for exceptions to the legal minimum age of
              marriage of 18 years for both women and men with parental consent. The Committee
              recommended amending the Marriage and Family Relations Act and all related national
              legislation to eliminate all exceptions to the legal minimum age of marriage of 18 years for
              both women and men. 64 UNESCO made a similar observation and a similar
              recommendation.65
              59.   The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women expressed
              concern about the incidence of child and/or forced marriage and early pregnancy among
              Roma girls and recommended that Slovenia eliminate child and/or forced marriage among
              Roma communities.66 The Committee against Torture stated that Slovenia should address the
              harmful consequences of such practices, investigate cases of child and forced marriage and
              prosecute the perpetrators.67

GE.24-19779                                                                                                            7
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


       3.   Persons with disabilities
            60.     The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
            that Slovenia ensure that all women and girls with disabilities were able to access the labour
            market, justice, inclusive education, employment and health services, including sexual and
            reproductive health services.68

       4.   Minorities
            61.    The Committee against Torture stated that it remained concerned about reports of
            Roma people living in deplorable conditions in numerous settlements and the impediments
            that they experienced in accessing education, employment and healthcare.69 Similarly, the
            Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with concern that
            Roma women faced social exclusion and had limited access to housing, healthcare, education
            and employment.70 The Committee against Torture recommended that Slovenia continue its
            efforts to promote access for Roma people to education, employment, healthcare and
            adequate living conditions.71
            62.    Noting a fundamental gap between adopted policies and programmes, on the one
            hand, and reality as experienced by members of the Roma minority, on the other hand, the
            ILO Committee of Experts requested the Government to continue to provide detailed
            information on the results of the various initiatives taken to promote non-discrimination in
            the education and employment of Roma women and men, and to take steps to collect and
            analyse relevant data, including comparable statistics to enable an accurate assessment of
            changes over time, while being sensitive to and respecting privacy.72
            63.    The Committee against Torture welcomed the formal public apology offered by the
            President of Slovenia in 2022 to 25,671 “erased” persons (persons from the former
            Yugoslavia who were removed from the country’s Register of Permanent Residents in 1992
            following the independence of Slovenia in 1991). However, the Committee observed that,
            according to information received, only 1,770 such persons had applied for restoration of
            their status within the legal deadline under the 2010 law, and only 241 had received
            permanent residence permits at the time, reportedly owing to the short time limits, the lack
            of information about the procedure and the difficulties in meeting the burden of proof. The
            Committee expressed concern about reports that several such persons remained stateless, that
            the erasure particularly affected people belonging to the Roma community and that many
            “erased” persons had received insufficient reparation under the Act Regulating
            Compensation for Damage Sustained as a Result of Erasure from the Register of Permanent
            Residents.73
            64.    Recalling its previous concluding observations,74 the same Committee recommended
            that Slovenia adopt additional measures to ensure that “erased” persons had the right to
            restore their permanent resident status, ensure that all individuals who had been victims of
            erasure received full and effective reparation and take all steps necessary to identify and
            protect stateless persons who had been subjected to erasure.75
            65.     Furthermore, the ILO Committee of Experts urged the Government to take steps to
            provide a fair compensation scheme for “erased” persons still waiting to be compensated, to
            take into account losses such as property or employment.76

       5.   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons
            66.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted the
            adoption of the new Family Code in 2019 and the recent amendments thereto recognizing
            same-sex marriage.77

       6.   Migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers
            67.   IOM noted the adoption of a new migrant inclusion strategy in 2023 and a new
            immigration strategy in 2024, aimed at ensuring a comprehensive approach to migration
            management and migrant inclusion.78
            68.   IOM noted that, while orientation programmes were implemented for asylum-seekers
            and beneficiaries of temporary and international protection, such programmes were lacking

8                                                                                                            GE.24-19779
                                                                                                       A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


              in local communities with a greater share of migrants among the population. IOM also noted
              that the scope of the free-of-charge Slovenian language course reportedly did not suffice to
              allow for mastery of the language to a sufficient level. Furthermore, IOM identified a lack of
              culturally and linguistically sensitive health services.79
              69.    IOM stated that migrants, including migrant women, often faced isolation and limited
              integration into society. IOM also stated that many migrants faced difficulties entering the
              labour market in Slovenia due to the fact that host communities were not familiar with
              migrants’ legal status or had mistrust towards and stereotypes about migrants.80
              70.     IOM recommended that Slovenia develop and provide accessible orientation
              programmes for migrants in local communities to empower them to navigate the public
              services available in those communities, while strengthening their inclusion in the local
              environment, and consider developing vocation-specific Slovenian language training to
              facilitate labour market inclusion and social inclusion.81
              71.    IOM also recommended that Slovenia provide regular and continued mandatory
              training on intercultural competencies for stakeholders working with migrants at the national
              and local levels and enhance the availability and accessibility of cultural mediation to ensure
              migrant-inclusive and migrant-sensitive measures.82
              72.     With respect to protection of equal conditions of work, the ILO Committee of Experts
              noted that the working conditions of migrants were regulated by the Employment
              Relationship Act of 2013, as amended, which applied equally to nationals, third-country
              nationals and posted workers. The ILO Committee of Experts noted that statistics on
              violations of the Employment Relationship Act were not disaggregated in such a way that
              made it possible to ascertain the number of violations of the Act pertaining to migrant
              workers. The ILO Committee of Experts asked the Government to consider taking steps to
              disaggregate statistics on violations of the Employment Relations Act so as to be able to
              monitor, ensure and report on the application of the Act to migrant workers, specifically with
              regard to equal protection in respect of remuneration, hours of work, overtime arrangements,
              rest periods and annual leave.83
              73.     The Committee against Torture expressed concern about reported cases of pushbacks
              and chain refoulement based on bilateral readmission agreements, which facilitated the
              “informal return” within 72 hours and without sufficient safeguards against potential
              refoulement of people who had entered the country irregularly and had not yet expressed an
              intention to seek asylum.84
              74.     UNHCR recommended that Slovenia maintain effective safeguards to ensure respect
              for the rights of persons seeking international protection, in particular respect for the principle
              of non-refoulement, at all times.85 Noting the commitments made by Slovenia in the context
              of the universal periodic review in November 201986 and the country’s obligations under the
              Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the Committee against Torture stated that
              Slovenia should refrain from engaging in pushbacks and refoulements that did not comply
              fully with its obligations under the Convention against Torture and ensure that all persons
              seeking protection in Slovenia had access to a fair and impartial review by an independent
              decision-making mechanism on expulsion, return or extradition, including in times of
              emergency and in exceptional situations. The Committee stated that, in particular, Slovenia
              should ensure that in practice no one could be expelled, returned or extradited to another
              State where there were substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of
              being subjected to torture and guarantee effective access to procedural safeguards, including
              information about the right to seek asylum, immediately and in a language the person could
              understand, access to legal assistance and the right to appeal adverse decisions, with
              automatic suspensive effect.87
              75.    UNHCR noted the absence of a structured mechanism to identify the early-stage needs
              and vulnerabilities of asylum-seekers, refugees and stateless persons, resulting in the
              under-identification of at-risk individuals, and of systematized procedures to identify
              survivors of gender-based violence or trafficking among new arrivals.88 The Committee on
              the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted with concern the lack of
              gender-sensitive legal and psychosocial counselling for refugees and asylum-seekers in



GE.24-19779                                                                                                              9
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/2


                 languages that they understood, resulting in underreporting of gender-based violence and
                 hampering their referral to appropriate services.89
                 76.    UNHCR recommended that Slovenia introduce efficient and systematic screening
                 procedures on arrival, to ensure early identification and effective referral mechanisms for
                 persons with specific needs, including presumed victims of trafficking and unaccompanied
                 and separated children, and strengthen the capacity of officials undertaking initial border and
                 asylum procedures through regular training, to effectively and swiftly identify persons with
                 specific needs and vulnerabilities.90 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
                 against Women recommended that Slovenia provide training on gender-sensitive protocols
                 for all actors dealing with refugees and asylum-seekers, including the Gender-Based
                 Violence Multidisciplinary Working Group, reduce overcrowding in reception centres and
                 demarcate segregated areas for women and men.91
                 77.    The Committee against Torture noted with concern reports indicating that, in practice,
                 accompanied or unaccompanied minors were detained in the centre for foreigners. The
                 Committee expressed concern about the lack of adequate accommodation for unaccompanied
                 or separated children in Slovenia and their placement in asylum centres or student
                 dormitories, where they lacked an individualized approach to their care based on an
                 assessment of their best interests.92
                 78.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia review its national legislation in
                 order to continue providing for the protection of children in situations of migration, ensure
                 that children and families with children were not detained solely because of their immigration
                 status and seek alternative accommodation for such individuals. The Committee stated that
                 Slovenia should also continue its efforts to provide appropriate accommodation for
                 unaccompanied and separated children in situations of migration, develop a multidisciplinary
                 system of care based on their best interests and individualized needs assessments and provide
                 sufficient protection safeguards.93
                 79.     UNHCR noted the increase in irregular arrivals in recent years and the insufficient
                 provision of adequate reception capacities in Slovenia, in particular during periods of peak
                 arrivals. 94 IOM stated that increased arrivals to Slovenia had resulted in overstretched
                 reception capacities and that many reception facilities had often been overcrowded in 2022
                 and 2023.95
                 80.     The Committee against Torture recommended that Slovenia intensify its efforts to
                 reduce overcrowding and improve the material conditions in the asylum centres in Ljubljana
                 and Logatec, including by guaranteeing access to adequate social, educational and health
                 services, and ensure that individuals held in those centres could bring complaints before an
                 effective, independent, confidential and accessible oversight mechanism.96
                 81.     IOM recommended that Slovenia provide adequate reception conditions to
                 asylum-seekers, compliant with international standards and obligations, and strengthen
                 collaboration with local communities to promote social inclusion and social cohesion. 97
                 UNHCR recommended developing basic standards for reception facilities for
                 asylum-seekers, including on the services and staffing standards necessary to facilitate
                 effective access to asylum, including individual support by a caseworker and support services
                 delivered by qualified staff.98

        7.       Stateless persons
                 82.    UNHCR recommended that Slovenia establish a statelessness determination
                 procedure to ensure the protection of stateless persons under the Convention relating to the
                 Status of Stateless Persons and implement legislation that codified the protection guarantees
                 contained therein.99
