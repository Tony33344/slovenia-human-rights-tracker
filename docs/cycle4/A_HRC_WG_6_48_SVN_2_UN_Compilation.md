A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


      I. Introduction
           1.     In March 2022, the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter: Slovenia) submitted to the UN
           OHCHR1 a voluntary mid-term report on the implementation of the UPR 3 rd cycle
           recommendations. The Inter-Ministerial Commission on Human Rights and NGOs were
           regularly informed about the implementation of the recommendations.
           2.     Slovenia’s preparations for the UPR 4th cycle started in autumn 2023. The report was
           drafted in cooperation with the relevant ministries and government departments under the
           coordination of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs and endorsed by the Inter-
           Ministerial Commission on Human Rights. The Government adopted it on 17 July 2024.
           3.     During the drafting of the report, the NGOs, the Ombudsman and the Advocate of the
           Principle of Equality were briefed and consulted.


     II. Implementation of recommendations from previous cycles

      A.   International obligations
           (Recommendations 1, 5, 7–9, 11–12, 158–160)

           4.      Since the previous review, Slovenia has ratified the International Convention for the
           Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (in 2021) and made a declaration
           recognising the competence of the Committee under Articles 31 and 32 of the Convention.
           First report on the implementation of the Convention is being prepared.
           5.   At the Global Refugee Forum in 2023, Slovenia announced its ratification of the
           Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. Slovenia is in favour of the UNHCR2 IBelong
           Campaign, aiming to eradicate statelessness by 2024.
           6.      Procedures are under way to examine the lessons learnt and the impact of the
           ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
           Cultural Rights and the 2014 Protocol to the ILO Forced Labour Convention.
           7.      Slovenia has an open, merit-based process for the selection of national candidates for
           UN treaty body elections. Line ministries issue a public call for expressions of interest in
           applying for nomination to UN treaty bodies. The selection panel interviews the candidates,
           and assesses their professional qualifications, on the basis of which the Government makes
           the final appointment.


      B.   Institutional framework of human rights protection
           (Recommendations 14–17, 161)

           8.      Slovenia considers that Recommendation 15 on a national human rights institution is
           fulfilled through the Human Rights Ombudsman, the Advocate for the Principle of Equality,
           who ensures the protection of the right to non-discrimination, and the Constitutional Court
           as the highest judicial body for the protection of constitutionality, legality, human rights and
           fundamental freedoms. Constitutional Court decides on constitutional complaints stemming
           from the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms by individual acts.
           9.      In 2021, the Human Rights Ombudsman received “A” status accreditation according
           to the Paris Principles. The Ombudsman’s work is funded by the Slovenian budget, and the
           funding was systematically regulated by the 2023 amendment to the Public Finance Act. In
           recent years, the allocated funds have increased significantly.
           10.    A proposed amendment of the Human Rights Ombudsman Act envisages the office
           of a Child Rights Ombudsman – Deputy Human Rights Ombudsman to deal exclusively with
           children’s rights, enjoying support from a special department for children’s rights.
           11.   With the adoption of the Family Code in 2017, the Council of the Republic of Slovenia
           for Children and Family3 was established as a permanent consultative body of the
           Government.

     12.    Slovenia will continue efforts to strengthen its equality bodies. With the Protection
     against Discrimination Act, the Advocate of the Principle of Equality became an autonomous
     and independent body with increased funding and staff capacity (from 19 public employees
     in 2021 to 24 in 2024).


C.   Non-discrimination and elimination of hate speech
     (Recommendations 22, 27–28, 30–41, 43–53, 56–57, 60, 163, 165–169)

     13.     The Constitution stipulates that everyone in Slovenia is guaranteed equal human rights
     and fundamental freedoms irrespective of personal circumstances (Article 14). The
     Protection against Discrimination Act defines the protection of every individual against
     discrimination, irrespective of their gender, nationality, race or ethnic origin, language,
     religion or beliefs, disability, age, sexual orientation, sexual identity or sexual expression,
     social position, property status, education or any other personal circumstance in social life
     when enforcing human rights and fundamental freedoms, exercising rights and obligations
     and in other legal relationships in political, economic, social, cultural, civil or other fields. A
     violation of the right to equality can constitute a criminal offence (Article 131 of the Criminal
     Code). Furthermore, the Constitution stipulates that any incitement to national, racial,
     religious, or other discrimination, and the inflaming of national, racial, religious, or other
     hatred and intolerance are unconstitutional (Article 63). Hate speech is criminalised under
     the Criminal Code (Article 297). Discrimination through public incitement to hatred,
     violence or intolerance is criminalised with a consistent transposition of international legal
     standards.
     14.   The amendment to the Criminal Code adopted in 2023 introduces hate crime as a
     mandatory aggravating circumstance to be taken into account in sentencing when the motive
     for committing the offence was any personal circumstance of the victim. 4 An offence
     committed out of hatred or prejudice based on the personal circumstances of the victim makes
     for more severe punishment.
     15.     In an important precedent-setting decision I Ips 65803/2012 of 2019, the Supreme
     Court confirmed that the elements of the offence of public incitement to hatred, violence or
     intolerance (Article 297 of the Criminal Code) exist not only when the act is committed "in
     a manner likely to jeopardise or disturb public order", but also when it is committed "by the
     use of threat, verbal abuse or insult".
     16.    Under the Protection of Public Order Act, incitement to intolerance is a minor offence
     (Article 20). Hate speech as a priority area is comprehensively defined in the Resolution on
     the National Programme of Crime Prevention and Suppression for the 2019–2023 and 2024–
     2028 periods.
     17.    The fight against discrimination is also included in the Government Migration
     Strategy.
     18.    Furthermore, the Media Act and the Audiovisual Media Services Act prohibit
     incitement to inequality and intolerance, including dissemination of programme content that
     incites national, racial, religious, sexual or any other inequality, violence and war, or
     provokes national, racial, religious, sexual or any other hatred and intolerance.
     19.    With regard to online media, publishers allowing public comments must establish and
     publish a comments policy. Comments in breach of the published policy must be withdrawn
     as soon as possible after they are reported as a way of effective self-regulation and reduction
     of online hate speech. This is also one of the objectives of the Resolution on the National
     Programme of Crime Prevention and Suppression for the 2019–2023.
     20.     The public national broadcaster RTV Slovenija plays a special role in awareness-
     raising and warning against illegal hate speech in the media. The RTV Slovenija Act
     stipulates that its programme must support the spread of knowledge about other cultures
     represented in Slovenia and their representatives, promote the culture of public dialogue and
     provide a wide platform for public debate on issues in society.




                                                                                                                3
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           21.     In March 2023, the Strategic Council for the Prevention of Hate Speech was
           established to monitor hate speech in Slovenia and at EU level and to propose activities to
           prevent it; to advise on policy development, regulatory changes and other measures to prevent
           hate speech more effectively; and to participate in preparing proposals for systemic changes
           and a network model for campaigns and training at regional and national levels. In 2023, the
           Strategy on Combating Antisemitism for the 2023–2033 period was adopted following the
           EU Strategy on Combating Antisemitism and Fostering Jewish Life (2021–2030). Its main
           areas of focus are: preventing and combating all forms of antisemitism; protecting and
           preserving Jewish culture; Holocaust education, research and remembrance.
           22.     The promotion of tolerance, diversity and equal opportunities in the learning process
           is laid down in the Organisation and Financing of Education Act. The elimination of racism
           and xenophobia and the prevention of all forms of discrimination is part of the curricula. In
           the National School of Leadership in Education, practitioners are systematically trained to
           identify violations of children's and human rights, treat children in a non-discriminatory
           manner, promote the principles of equal opportunities and respect the human dignity of all
           participants in the educational process (children, teachers, parents). 5 Another project that is
           being implemented is “Hand in hand: EmPOWERing teachers across Europe to deal with
           social, emotional and diversity related career challenges”.6
           23.     The education system in Slovenia also includes activities to ensure a safe and
           stimulating learning environment for optimal individual development. Experts deal with
           activities in the areas of violence prevention and promotion of social emotional learning,
           education of children with special needs, gifted children, migrants, Roma, inclusive
           education, mental health, psychosocial support and assistance, curriculum, sport, physical
           activity and healthy lifestyle, primary school extended programme, music education and
           cooperation with parents.
           24.    Through various projects, Slovenia aims to enhance mutual knowledge and
           intercultural dialogue, understanding and acceptance of differences.7
           25.    The active implementation of the UDHR8 continues through cultural and arts
           education, where children and young people learn about the different art forms and the social
           impact of cultural arts (cultural diversity, intercultural awareness and dialogue, social and
           civic competences).
           26.     The state gives special consideration to the education of Roma pupils and provides
           schools with benefits: additional funding, more favourable norms for classes with Roma
           pupils, funding for meals, textbooks, excursions, funding for research and development tasks
           for better integration of Roma pupils, and language standardisation as a basis for teaching
           Romani.
           27.     Primary schools provide elective classes in Roma culture about history, lifestyle and
           cultural creativity. Pupils also develop the ability to understand the lifestyle of different
           national/ethnic groups coexisting in the same area. In this context, teacher training is
           paramount, and teaching materials and manuals are being produced in Romani. Every year,
           the state co-finances supplementary home language and culture classes for children of other
           national communities.
           28.    In line with international best practice, an update of the safe and enabling environment
           protocols began in early 2024, aiming to ensure greater visibility of marginalised groups –
           the socially vulnerable, LGBTI, children with special needs, migrants, Roma girls and people
           with disabilities.
           29.    To raise awareness, the Ministry of Education informs educational institutions
           through circular letters about the commemoration of important (international) human rights
           days and anniversaries. The issues raised in the Recommendation are addressed in primary
           and secondary schools, e.g. in the scope of Civic and Homeland Education and Ethics.
           30.    In 2022 and 2023, a training programme entitled “Recognising Stereotypes,
           Overcoming Prejudice and Eliminating Discrimination in a Multicultural Society” was
           organised for police officers and other police staff. The aim was to impart knowledge on how
           to identify and understand different forms of discrimination and to learn about the
           specificities of individual multicultural communities, models of good practice and how to

4
                                                                                             A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


     successfully tackle problematic situations. Equal treatment, specificities of multicultural
     communities and prevention of discrimination in relation to the Roma community are an
     integral part of the police officers training programmes at the Police College.
     31.    More information on activities for the inclusion of members of the Roma community
     is provided in the chapter on Roma. Programmes and projects to combat discrimination
     against children, people with disabilities and older persons are also detailed in individual
     chapters.
     32.     Slovenia continues to raise awareness of hate speech, conducts targeted research
     projects to analyse online hate speech, co-funds training to strengthen digital and media
     literacy for all citizens, organises campaigns on online peer violence and participates in the
     European Commission's call for proposals for funding the Safer Internet Centre project. In
     2022, the "Bite Your Hateful Tongue!” short videos campaign was launched featuring
     Slovenian athletes to raise awareness of the unacceptability of hate speech and offensive
     language. In 2024, the “Don't Roast When You Post” campaign about online violence and
     hate speech was launched.

     LGBTI
     33.    Slovenia will continue to implement anti-discrimination measures in the framework
     of public tenders and at the level of state bodies, local authorities, holders of public authority
     and legal and natural persons.
     34.    In 2023, a decision was taken to develop a national LGBTI equality strategy by the
     end of 2024.9
     35.   An inter-ministerial working group on legal gender recognition was set up to examine
     the adequacy of the legal framework in Slovenia. A report with findings and
     recommendations was issued in 2021.
     36.    The police implemented the TRUST CO(O)P project, which established and improved
     cooperation with the LGBTI community and introduced a police liaison officer between the
     police and the LGBTI community.


D.   Political and civil rights
     (Recommendations 73–76)

     37.    Court backlogs are no longer a systemic problem in Slovenia.10 The 2023 EU Justice
     Scoreboard has again recognised the improved efficiency of the Slovenian justice system. It
     also shows that general government total expenditure on courts in EUR per capita is
     increasing.
     38.     Under the Criminal Procedure Act, suspects have the right to a defence counsel from
     the moment they are deprived of liberty. In 2020, the amended Criminal Procedure Act 11
     introduced new provisions on the rights of a minor during deprivation of liberty and the right
     of a minor to a defence counsel. Upon deprivation of liberty, a minor is informed that
     deprivation of liberty may only be imposed as a measure of last resort, is limited to the
     shortest appropriate period of time and is subject to periodic judicial review. When deprived
     of liberty, a minor has the right to a medical examination, have parents or guardians informed,
     maintain contact with them and exercise effectively and regularly the right to family life. A
     minor must be detained separately from adults. Only exceptionally can he be detained with
     adults if it is in the child's best interests. Appropriate measures must be taken to ensure and
     preserve a minor’s health and physical and mental development, and in the event of
     prolonged deprivation of liberty (detention), ensure their right to education and access to
     programmes that foster their development and reintegration into society. A minor has the
     right to be assisted by a defence counsel at any stage of the proceedings. In cases of
     deprivation of liberty or in other cases where mandatory defence is envisaged the defence
     counsel is appointed ex officio by the competent authority if a minor or their legal
     representatives or relatives do not engage a defence counsel themselves. The proposed Act
     Amending the Criminal Procedure Act in legislative procedure establishes a list of rights of
     which a minor must be notified in writing upon deprivation of liberty. The notification must


                                                                                                               5
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           be given in simple and accessible language and in the minor's mother tongue or in a language
           the minor understands.
           39.    Slovenia constantly strives to improve the living conditions in Slovenian prisons. The
           construction of a new Ljubljana Prison began in 2022 and is expected to be completed in
           2025, alleviating the spatial constraints of the existing main prison in Ljubljana by providing
           functional, modern, secure and energy-efficient premises. To ease the consequences of
           overcrowding and understaffing in prisons, an amendment to the Enforcement of Criminal
           Sanctions Act is currently in the legislative procedure.


      E.   Economic, social and cultural rights
           (Recommendations 20, 62–66, 88–92, 94–97, 125–126, 162, 183–184)

           40.     The implementation of the SDGs12 and the monitoring of progress are linked to the
           Slovenian Development Strategy 2030 adopted by the Government in 2017, the goal of which
           is to ensure quality life for all.13
           41.    Member States joining the EU after 2002 are committed to “gradually increase ODA14
           to 0.33% of gross national income (GNI) by 2030”. This commitment was endorsed by the
           National Assembly, which called on the Government to draw up an Action Plan on the
           gradual increase of GNI for ODA.
           42.    As an EU Member State, Slovenia is subject to the EU NDC15 and thus to a minimum
           55% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. Slovenia is
           drafting a Climate Change Act to set a national long-term climate target to reduce GHG
           emissions, increase carbon sinks and adapt to climate change. It is also updating its Integrated
           National Energy and Climate Plan and remains active in climate negotiations.
           43.    In Slovenia, public participation in the regulatory process is mandatory under the
           Resolution on Legislative Regulation.16 The preparation of the Climate Change Act has
           involved the widest possible range of stakeholders. Prior to drafting, the public was invited
           to make suggestions on its content and the first draft was subject to public consultation.
           Suggestions from different stakeholders have been incorporated in the new draft, which is
           currently undergoing inter-ministerial coordination.
           44.    Slovenia has adopted the Resolution on the National Housing Programme 2015-2025.
           The Resolution pays particular attention to the housing needs of the young, older persons and
           vulnerable groups. In 2023, EUR 25,500,000.00 of budget funds have been allocated for the
           recapitalisation of the Slovenian Housing Fund. In Slovenia, one of the rights from public
           funds is the right to rent subsidy, which is a way of addressing housing problems of socially
           disadvantaged people.17 Currently, Slovenia is developing a housing reform to increase the
           number of affordable public rental housing.
           45.     In 2023, the Long-Term Care Act was adopted as an important step towards building
           a robust and accessible public long-term care system. The Act puts the person in need of
           long-term care at the centre of the system allowing them to decide how they want to exercise
           their right to long-term care. It introduces two further rights, the right to services to promote
           and maintain independence and the right to e-care services. The Dementia Management
           Strategy until 2030 was also adopted in 2023, which is the cornerstone for a coordinated and
           integrated approach by all stakeholders to tackle dementia and related conditions.
           46.     Slovenia continues to improve access to healthcare for all, including in rural areas, for
           people with disabilities and older persons, in particular the availability and accessibility of
           palliative care. In 2023, the Act Amending the Mental Health Act was adopted as per the
           decisions of the Constitutional Court. Based on the Resolution on the National Mental Health
           Programme 2018-2028, a network of mental health centres is being set up at the primary
           healthcare level.
           47.     In Slovenia, the education system is a public service provided by public and private
           institutions and private providers with a concession.18 As per the Constitution, primary
           education is compulsory and publicly funded.

48.    To eliminate regional disparities in access to education, Slovenia is equalising the
share of funding for education projects in the eastern and western regions.
49.     The 2021 amendment to the Kindergarten Act provides, among other things, for the
reintroduction of free kindergarten for certain categories of children. The amended act details
the status of a home-based childminder and distinguishes between pre-school education and
childminding and other services provided to pre-school children. In 2019, new Rules on the
management of textbook funds were published, providing a legal basis for the distribution of
free school materials from 1st to 3rd year pupils from the 2019/20 school year on. Slovenia
also undertook other measures to ease the financial burden on parents. 19
50.   Measures and education projects for Roma children are detailed in the chapter on
Roma.
51.    Basic School Act stipulates that children who are foreign citizens or stateless persons
and reside in Slovenia have the right to compulsory basic school education under the same
conditions as Slovenian citizens. Children of compulsory school age are entitled to enrol in
school even if the family is still in the process of settling its residence status and has not yet
acquired formal permanent or temporary residence. Foreigners may enrol in Slovenian
secondary schools under the same conditions as Slovenian citizens, also under the
International Protection Act.20
52.    In 2020, Slovenia adopted the Act on the Intervention for Children and Youth with
Emotional and Behavioural disorders in Education.21 In 2021, an amendment to the Rules on
additional professional and physical assistance for children with special needs was adopted.
53.     The amendments to the Rules on the organisation, operation and financing of state-
funded short programme pre-school groups were adopted in 2020 to remove barriers to access
to free, shorter pre-school education for all children not enrolled in kindergarten one year
before they qualify for primary school.
54.     Slovenia has upgraded ICT22 equipment in schools and earmarked funds for the
development and acquisition of digital skills in education. In 2023, digital literacy projects
were implemented for children and young people, for people aged 30+ and specifically
tailored for people aged 55+.
55.     A major reform is also under way to modernise curricula by integrating all aspects of
financial literacy into the education system and beyond. Programmes focus on awareness,
knowledge and skills, attitudes and behaviours enabling good financial decisions and
financial well-being, thereby contributing to resilience, social responsibility and a more
efficient functioning of the financial system in general.
56.    The higher education programme “Police Officer” enables police officers to hone their
knowledge and skills related to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in
police procedures. Key training topics include equal treatment and the particularities of a
multicultural community, including prevention of discrimination with specificities of the
Roma community. The Police provide training for senior officers to familiarise them with
the specificities of police work in the Roma community. The protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms in police procedures is a compulsory subject in the regular training of
police officers. In 2022 and 2023, a training programme entitled “Recognising stereotypes,
overcoming prejudice and eliminating discrimination in a multicultural society” was
organised for police officers and other police staff, with the aim of providing them with the
necessary knowledge to recognise and understand different forms of discrimination.
57.     Among the 39 rich EU and OECD countries, Slovenia has progressed the most over
the past decade in reducing the number of children living below the poverty line, and is the
world's best performer in UNICEF child poverty index. Regarding children’s rights, the Child
Guarantee National Action Plan 2022-2030 was adopted in 2023. One of its aims is to prevent
the intergenerational transmission of poverty. The reduction of poverty is the main objective
of the Resolution on the National Social Assistance Programme 2022-2030. Slovenia will
continue its efforts to reduce poverty and increase the inclusion of vulnerable groups,
including older persons.




                                                                                                          7
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           58.      The Resolution sets out guidelines for the functioning and development of the social
           assistance system which, along with social policies, makes an important contribution to long-
           term, sustainable and inclusive growth in society by reducing social inequalities and
           exclusion. To activate long-term unemployed recipients of social assistance and integrate
           them into the labour market, Slovenia will continue the social activation project integrating
           it into the social assistance system as a service.23
           59.     A special working group for sustainable dialogue with representatives of the German-
           speaking ethnic group in Slovenia was established in 2020 and expanded in 2022. It addresses
           outstanding issues in the work areas of the participating ministries. In addition to
           representatives of the relevant ministries and the Government Office for National Minorities,
           it includes representatives of the three umbrella organisations of the German-speaking ethnic
           group in Slovenia. Annual calls for proposals are issued for the selection of cultural projects
           under the programme for members of the German-speaking ethnic group.


      F.   Good governance and business and human rights
           (Recommendations 68–69)

           60.     The fight against corruption is one of priorities of Slovenian Government. The
           detection, investigation, prosecution and adjudication of corruption offences are the
           responsibility of the Police, State Prosecutor's Office and courts. In 2020, an amendment to
           the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act was adopted.24
           61.     In 2023, the Whistleblowers Protection Act was adopted. It introduces important
           measures to protect whistleblowers in their working environment and sets out additional
           obligations to establish reporting channels for public and private sector entities. The Act
           assigns additional tasks to the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (monitoring the
           implementation of the Act, assistance to entities and annual reporting). In 2023, the
           Government adopted the Programme for Strengthening Integrity and Transparency in the
           Public Sector 2023-2026 to ensure greater transparency in public administration. The
           envisaged measures are largely preventive in nature, cover several areas and include
           measures to increase the integrity and transparency of state and local self-government
           officials. The second six-monthly interim report on the implementation of the programme
           was adopted in 2024. A proposal for a revised Resolution on the Prevention of Corruption
           was drafted in 2023. Strengthening activities to detect corruption-related crimes and their
           perpetrators at all levels, including economic crime, is also a priority for the Police, as set out
           in the Guidelines for the Mid-term Police Plan 2023-2027.
           62.   According to statistical data trade with conflict areas is minimal, including with
           occupied territories with an increased risk of human rights violations. This is part of the EU's
           common trade policy.


      G.   National communities and the Roma community
           (Recommendations 121–123, 128–131, 133–143, 200–205)

           63.     Measures to exercise the rights of minorities and improve the situation of members of
           the Italian and Hungarian national communities and the Roma community are regulated by
           law and part of comprehensive national plans. The Programme of Measures for the exercising
           of special rights of the Italian and Hungarian national communities 2021-2025 was adopted
           in 2021, and the National Programme of Measures for Roma 2021-2030 (NPUR) in 2021.
           The Government regularly reports to the National Assembly on the implementation of the
           NPUR, which is evaluated through various mechanisms. 25
           64.     NPUR’s implementation is regularly monitored by the Government working group,
           composed of representatives of ministries and government bodies, municipalities with Roma
           settlements and representatives of the Roma Community Council. Slovenia will continue its
           efforts to improve the situation of the Roma community and their inclusion in society.
           65.    Recommendations for educational institutions with Roma children, pupils and young
           people are set out in the Strategy for the Education of Roma, updated in 2021.

66.     Members of the Roma community are offered specific social security programmes
that facilitate their integration and the exercise of their human rights. The implementation of
social activation programmes for Roma women's entry into the labour market ended in 2022.
67.    Multi-purpose Roma centres carry out activities to promote the integration of Roma
children and their enrolment in primary school and kindergarten.26
68.     In activities aimed at Roma families, parents learn about the importance of education,
the inclusion of children in pre-school and school, a healthy lifestyle and systematic medical
check-ups for children's health and development.
69.     Roma families enjoy several benefits (e.g. reduced kindergarten fees, pre-school
programmes for children not enrolled in kindergarten). Through multi-annual projects of
multi-purpose Roma centres, workshops are offered for the social activation, social
integration and empowerment of Roma, bringing them closer to the labour market. One of
the main purposes of these programmes is to prepare children for school, strengthen their
skills in their mother tongue and in the language of instruction, and establish routines.
70.    The by-laws provide for more favourable standards for a second first grade teacher in
classes with at least three Roma pupils, a specialist working with Roma pupils and a Roma
assistant. In cases with special working conditions, a derogation from the standards may be
granted. In the Dolenjska region, where the Roma situation is particularly acute, specific
measures were granted to primary schools in the 2023/24 school year and even before, such
as classes with smaller numbers of pupils, when they include Roma children, and the
employment of a Roma assistant and a specialist teacher.
71.     In 2023, the project Multi-purpose Roma Centres as Innovative Learning
Environments ran at the Centre for School and Outdoor Education, aimed at strengthening
the general and vocational competences, skills and knowledge of Roma children to promote
their inclusion in the education system and society.
72.    In 2023, the Centre for School and Outdoor Education also held its third consecutive
training for Roma assistants to empower candidates and provide them with the relevant
knowledge, skills and competences to work more successfully with Roma children and their
parents.
73.    Also, the next edition of the project Together for Knowledge: Activities of Multi-
purpose Roma Centres was launched in 2023 and will run until 2028. The project focuses on
strengthening and improving language skills, especially among pre-school and primary
school children.
74.     Teaching materials on Roma for Roma children were published in the form of
trilingual – Slovene, Prekmurje Romani and English – flashcards and books. Supplementary
classes in Roma language and culture, testing of approaches to promote the use of Romani,
learning about Roma cultural heritage and other language learning activities are also being
implemented for Roma children. Innovative teaching practices have been developed for those
who work with Roma children.
75.    In 2022, the Police launched a prevention project School – Path to Success to improve
the safety situation associated with Roma and their integration.
76.    In 2022, a court interpreter for Romani was appointed.
77.    Cultural projects aimed at the preservation, promotion and development of Roma
culture, language and identity are co-funded through annual calls for proposals.27
Programmes on Roma culture, language and identity aimed at raising public awareness of
the existence of the Roma community and their cultural diversity are also funded through an
annual public call for applications for NGOs for co-financing media programmes, for
instance in 2017–2023, the Bridge of Coexistence programme on Radio Romic which aims
to eliminate prejudice against Roma and to present Roma issues, life, customs and culture.
The RTV Slovenia Act stipulates that the programmes of the public national broadcaster RTV
Slovenia must support the spread of knowledge about other cultures represented in Slovenia
and their representatives, promote the culture of public dialogue and provide a wide platform
for public debate on social issues. The radio programme Our Paths – Amare Droma is



                                                                                                       9
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           broadcast once a week, and What are you saying? – So vakeres? bi-weekly; both are produced
           by Roma.
           78.     The Resolution on the National Programme for Language Policy 2021-2025 provides
           expert guidelines on language policy decisions and measures. In addition to measures relating
           to the Slovene language, it includes measures relating to Italian, Hungarian, Romani and the
           languages of other communities and immigrants. 28
           79.     Minority ethnic communities (Italian and Hungarian national communities and the
           Roma community) are adequately represented in the elected bodies of the municipalities in
           which they live. In municipalities that elect a representative of the Roma community to the
           city or municipal council under the Local Self-Government Act, a special working body is
           established within the municipal council to monitor the situation of the Roma community.
           The elected representative of the Roma community on the municipal council is a member of
           this working body by virtue of their function.
           80.    According to the State Administration Act, the official language of the administration
           is Slovene. In municipalities with Hungarian or Italian national communities, the official
           languages of the administration are also Hungarian and Italian, respectively, and the
           administrative units in these areas are obliged to provide bilingual administrative services.
           81.   Administrative units must ensure that their staff have adequate knowledge of the
           language of the national community and appropriate skills. Their internal organisation and
           systematisation acts must provide for posts requiring a certain level of knowledge of the
           language of the national community.
           82.    To ensure the effective implementation of legislation on the use of minority
           languages, annual consultations on the implementation of bilingualism are held in the nine
           municipalities with members of the Italian and Hungarian national communities. In 2023, the
           eighth consultation focused on the exchange of experience on the translation of legal acts
           from Italian into Slovene and vice versa, the monitoring of the implementation of
           bilingualism provisions and the financing of self-governing national communities.
           83.     Bilingualism in traffic signalling is regulated by the Rules on traffic signalling and
           traffic equipment on roads. In bilingual areas, the Hungarian or Italian language is used in
           the Inspectorate for Agriculture, Forestry, Hunting and Fisheries and in the regional branch
           offices of the Administration for Food Safety, Veterinary Sector and Plant Protection. The
           Maritime Directorate also provides services in the language of the national community. The
           Judicial Training Centre regularly holds workshops on legal terminology in minority
           languages for judges, public prosecutors, state attorneys and judicial staff. The courts have
           new websites in Italian and Hungarian.
           84.     According to the latest report of the Inter-ministerial Working Group tasked to resolve
           housing problems in Roma settlements, in 2017, 6,631 people lived in 83 Roma settlements,
           all of them with access to drinking water. 5,398 inhabitants (81.4% of the Roma population
           compared to 88.6% of the general population) were supplied by the public water supply, and
           1,201 by other sources. Some 32.2% of Roma were connected to the public sewage system
           (compared to 62% of the entire Slovenian population). A new spatial planning and
           construction legislation entered into force in 2018.29 The possibility of legalisation will also
           apply to buildings in settlements with social groups such as the Roma. As part of the NPUR
           2021–2030, a public call for applications was published for the co-financing of basic utility
           infrastructure projects in Roma settlements in 2023 and 2024; 13 projects were selected for
           co-financing in 2023, and 6 projects in 2024.


      H.   Gender equality
           (Recommendations 22–24, 99–108, 164, 186–195)

           85.     Slovenia will continue to promote gender equality, also by upgrading legislation, and
           will strive for continued progress in the implementation of strategies aimed at achieving
           gender equality in all areas of economic, political and social life, including in employment
           and equal pay. In 2023, the Resolution on the National Programme for Equal Opportunities
           for Women and Men 2023-2030 was adopted. The new programme includes measures to


10
                                                                                          A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


     ensure equal economic independence, eliminate all forms of violence against women and
     girls, promote and ensure a balanced representation of women and men, eliminate gender
     stereotypes and sexism, as well as inequalities in women's and men's health, and measures to
     ensure gender equality and the empowerment of women in foreign policy and development
     cooperation. The Resolution also provides for the promotion and protection of sexual and
     reproductive health, with a special focus on adolescents and women in perinatal period.
     Measures include ensuring access to primary reproductive healthcare. A Periodic Plan 2024-
     2025 for the implementation of the Resolution is under preparation.
     86.     For a balanced representation of women and men in politics and public life, the project
     Empowering Women for Active Political Life was devised. In workshops, secondary school
     students learn about gender stereotypes that hinder women's participation in politics. The aim
     is to address and encourage young people to overcome these stereotypes and reject traditional
     gender roles at a formative age.
     87.     The Police continues to have an Equal Opportunities Coordinator and the Ministry of
     the Interior has an Advisory Board for Gender Mainstreaming with staff from different work
     areas. Together, they promote gender equality by raising awareness among staff about the
     importance of gender equality and conducting workshops for newly recruited police officers
     and senior management. In 2023, on the 50th anniversary of recruiting female uniformed
     police officers, the Police mounted the exhibition “Where are the Women?” with an
     accompanying brochure. A major study “Some aspects of police organisational life: gender
     differences” has been completed.
     88.    With 17% women, the Slovenian Armed Forces rank very high among NATO
     member armies and are in line with NATO's gender policy. Prior to deployment on
     international missions and operations, awareness training is provided by a network of gender
     advisers. With equal opportunities and conditions for promotion, women in the Slovenian
     Armed Forces occupy the most important decision-making positions and are involved in
     almost all areas of activity.
     89.    The number of women in senior positions in companies is gradually increasing. An
     amendment to the Companies Act is pending to achieve a more balanced gender
     representation in top management in listed companies.
     90.    In 2024, the Government adopted the Resolution on the National Programme for the
     Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women 2024-2029, which includes
     a number of measures to combat domestic violence. Its objectives include zero tolerance of
     domestic violence and violence against women, a high level of public awareness and
     preventive action through general and specific measures. In 2023, the Police published an
     action plan on domestic violence, which focuses on prevention, professional treatment,
     cooperation with other institutions working in the field of domestic violence, raising
     awareness of this issue and its scope, and support for victims.


I.   Persons with disabilities
     (Recommendations 113–117, 124, 196–199)

     91.     Slovenia pays particular attention to ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all
     human rights and fundamental freedoms by persons with disabilities, as provided for in the
     Constitution. The right to special protection for people with disabilities includes a range of
     different rights in the areas of parental care and family benefits, education, employment,
     health, disability insurance, social protection, culture, sport and recreation, tax relief and
     other forms of exemption, ICT, accessibility of the built environment and information, and
     all other areas that enable these people to live a life of dignity and equality. Slovenia has
     always drafted legislation in cooperation with people with disabilities and has always adhered
     to the principle: "Nothing about people with disabilities without people with disabilities”.
     92.    Disability legislation in Slovenia does not specifically focus on specific groups of
     people with disabilities, but covers all types of disability and all sub-groups. In its chapter
     Eliminating gender inequalities in employment and ensuring equal economic independence




                                                                                                           11
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           for women and men, the Resolution on the National Programme for Equal Opportunities for
           Women and Men 2023-2030 also includes targets for women with disabilities.
           93.     To combat discrimination on the grounds of disability, Slovenia adopted the
           Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities Act, which defines discrimination
           as any distinction, exclusion or restriction on the basis of disability with the purpose or effect
           of impairing or nullifying the equal recognition, enjoyment or exercise of all rights and
           obligations in all vital areas of life.30 In 2021, in line with the Act, the Action Programme for
           Persons with Disabilities 2020–2030 was adopted to promote, protect and guarantee the full
           and equal enjoyment of all human rights of persons with disabilities and respect for their
           dignity.31 The 13 objectives of the programme cover all areas of life of persons with
           disabilities. A special commission annually monitors the implementation.
           94.     In 2021, a constitutional act was adopted amending the Constitution to include the
           right to use and develop Slovene sign language, followed by the Action Plan for the Inclusion
           of Slovene Sign Language in Pre-school, Primary and Secondary Education 2021-2024. The
           use and development of the language of the deafblind will be regulated by a special act.
           95.     One of the objectives of the Organisation and Financing of Education Act is to provide
           the optimal development of an individual, irrespective of gender, social background or
           cultural identity, religion, racial, ethnic or national origin, and regardless of their physical
           and mental constitution or disability. Additional positive measures are implemented through
           a project-based and systemic approaches. A special section of the Catalogue of Further
           Education Programmes for Teachers in Educational Institutions is dedicated to the education
           of children with special needs, with the individual child and adolescent and their development
           at its core.32
           96.     Students with hearing loss are included in education programmes with adapted
           implementation and additional expert assistance in regular schools, or in education
           programmes adapted to the needs of children with hearing loss implemented by educational
           institutions for children and young adults with special needs.33
           97.     In 2024, the National Assembly Elections Act was amended to no longer allow courts
           to disenfranchise voters on the grounds of mental disability. Voters with a long-term physical,
           mental, intellectual or sensory impairment may be assisted in voting by a person of their
           choice. These voters could already vote in the European Parliament elections in June 2024.
           98.    The Resolution on the National Programme for the Prevention of Domestic Violence
           and Violence against Women 2024-2029 includes measures to support victims of violence
           with specific personal circumstances.


      J.   Erased persons
           (Recommendations 156, 215)

           99.    In 2018, Slovenia adopted the Act amending the Act Regulating the Compensation
           for Damage Sustained as a Result of Erasure from the Register of Permanent Residents,
           which removes the limitation on the amount of monetary compensation that can be awarded
           to a beneficiary in court proceedings and limits the amount of interest on late payment to the
           principal amount.


      K.   Children and youth
           (Recommendations 19, 70, 72, 87, 109–112, 170–172)

           100. On the basis of the Act on Public Interest in the Youth Sector, the adoption of the
           Resolution on the National Programme for Youth for the period 2024–2032 is planned for
           2024. Carried out in close cooperation with youth organisations, the preparation of the
           document was based mainly on the national Youth 2020 survey, providing a scientific
           perspective on the changing situation of young people and the trends and circumstances they
           face (including the identification and prevention of violence and peer violence).

101. Measures for the promotion and enforcement of the human rights of young people are
stipulated in the Organisation and Financing of Education Act. The educational objectives
defined in the Act include those contributing to the realisation of the right of every person to
education without discrimination or exclusion and to the promotion of equal opportunities in
education.34 As part of the curriculum renewal process, the Common Aims document was
approved in 2023, providing guidance to embed active citizenship content in all subjects, as
appropriate.
102. In 2020, the Programme for Children 2020-2025 (PO20–25) was adopted and the
accompanying Action Plans for the Implementation of the Programme 2020-2025 in 2021
and 2024. The PO20–25 is an independent strategic document defining the main objectives
and actions in the field of children's rights and children's well-being and quality of life. It is
aligned with key international documents and the country's development documents on
children, taking into account specific aspects of the needs and quality of life of children in
Slovenia. Through the PO20–25, the country aims to raise the level of child well-being,
ensure equal opportunities and rights for all children, strengthen protection and safeguarding,
and improve opportunities for inclusion and participation of all children regardless of their
personal circumstances, which is also a commitment of EU Member States. A special chapter
is dedicated to children's participation at all levels of society. 35
103. In 2023, the Child Guarantee National Action Plan 2022–2030 was adopted, which
aims to create equal opportunities for all children and to prevent the intergenerational
transmission of poverty.
104. Two representatives of children were appointed to the Government Council for
Children and Family, and children participated in the drafting of the Child Guarantee
National Action Plan 2022-2030.
105. The Family Code defines a family as a living community of a child, regardless of the
child’s age, with both or one of the parents or with another adult, if that person is taking care
for the child and has certain obligations and rights under the Code in relation to that child. In
2018, the Resolution on the Family Policy 2018-2028: “A Society Friendly to All Families”
was adopted, which defines measures by areas. Two of the four action plans to implement
the Resolution have been adopted, and an action plan for the period 2024–2026 is under
preparation. From 2020 to 2022, the Action Dad project aimed to raise awareness among
(prospective) parents, employers, professionals and the general public about the importance
of actively involving men in childcare and a more equal distribution of parental care for the
child from birth on. The amendment to the Parental Protection and Family Benefit Act
introduced important changes in the area of childcare: 160 days of parental leave for both
parents, the right to work part-time to care for a child until the child’s eighth birthday, the
possibility for both parents to work part-time at the same time, and a higher compensation
for loss of income.
106. The Domestic Violence Prevention Act prohibits all forms of domestic violence and
corporal punishment and all other forms of violence and discrimination in all educational
institutions. One of the objectives of the Draft Resolution on the National Programme for the
Prevention of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women 2024-2029 is to achieve zero
tolerance of domestic violence and violence against children. Among the proposed measures
is also a survey on the physical punishment of children in the family. In 2023, the police
issued a Domestic Violence Action Plan 2023-2024, which covers the prevention of physical
punishment of children. The Action Plan aims to raise awareness among the (wider) public
about the unacceptability of violence. (Media) campaigns and prevention activities spread
the message of the unacceptability of violence and child neglect. Public calls for social
assistance programmes include violence prevention programmes. The Resolution on the
National Social Assistance Programme for the period 2022–2030 foresees further growth of
the network of social assistance programmes aimed at preventing violence. Educators have a
duty to respond to all forms of violence in educational settings and in cases of domestic
violence against children. Guidelines have been developed to deal with violence in schools
and domestic violence. In addition, education and training are provided for staff in
educational institutions.




                                                                                                         13
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           107. According to the Criminal Code, violence within the family or any other permanent
           community is a criminal offence. The prosecution policy of the State Prosecutor of the
           Republic of Slovenia gives priority to the prosecution of crimes against vulnerable persons
           (e.g. children, persons with physical or mental disabilities, persons in a subordinate
           relationship). In these cases, the procedures must be quick and provide comprehensive
           support to victims. This area is also regulated by the Police Tasks and Powers Act, the
           Criminal Procedure Act and the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, while measures for the
           protection of victims of domestic violence are a priority area in the Resolution on the National
           Programme for the Prevention and Suppression of Crime 2019–2023 and 2024–2028 and the
           Resolution on the National Programme for the Prevention of Domestic Violence and
           Violence against Women 2024–2029. The Resolution's biennial action plans also include
           targeted activities and awareness-raising projects on violence against vulnerable groups. The
           police are working to ensure that victims from vulnerable groups are treated with special
           care; police officers and criminal investigators who come into contact with victims of
           domestic violence in the course of their work receive special training.
           108. The protection of child victims of exploitation and sexual abuse is addressed in the
           Resolution on the National Programme for the Prevention and Suppression of Crime 2019–
           2023 and 2024–2028. The 2021 Act on the Protection of Children in Criminal Procedure and
           their Comprehensive Treatment in Children's House introduces the Barnahus model of
           treatment for child victims of sexual abuse and other crimes into the Slovenian legal system. 36
           The 2021 Action Plan on Investigating Child Sexual Abuse provides for more training for
           police officers and criminal investigators to identify and deal with child sexual abuse more
           effectively, quickly and professionally, and to obtain evidence for court proceedings more
           effectively. The Action Plan also requires police officers and criminal investigators to raise
           awareness of physical and online child sexual abuse through prevention activities.
           109. The 2019 amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act strengthened the position of
           victims in criminal proceedings, including by informing them of their rights, providing
           individual assessment and ensuring protective measures. Furthermore, the 2021 amendment
           to the Criminal Code replaced the coercion model in relation to the crimes of rape, sexual
           violence and sexual abuse of a vulnerable person with an affirmative consent model. Two
           largest courts of first instance have established a Victim Support Service to assist in
           communicating with victims and developing measures to protect them. Since 2019, Social
           Work Centres have had a free support network for victims of crime, regardless of whether
           the victim has reported the crime or not. The support includes professional help and expert
           advice for the person directly affected by the crime.
           110. Pursuant to the International Protection Act, child applicants for international
           protection and children under international or temporary protection have the same rights as
           Slovenian citizens in terms of access to education and healthcare, and conditions at reception
           (accommodation and food) are adapted to their needs.


      L.   Older persons
           (Recommendations 18, 71, 93, 173, 185)

           111. Changing demographics have placed the issues of older persons at the centre of social
           and healthcare systems. With the growing proportion of older persons in Slovenia, special
           attention is being paid to increasing the scope of long-term care and other services tailored
           to older persons to improve their daily lives and inclusion. The two Resolutions on the
           National Social Assistance Programme (2013–2020 and 2020–2030) focus on this aspect of
           social change.
           112. The 2017 Active Ageing Strategy defines guidelines for the prevention of violence
           against older persons, including the systematic collection of data and inter-ministerial
           cooperation; awareness-raising among the older population and the general public about
           violence and other unlawful acts targeting older persons; systematic training of healthcare
           and social workers, police and others that come into contact with violence to recognise,
           prevent and report abuse and violence against older persons; strengthened inter-institutional
           cooperation in tackling abuse, violence and other illicit acts against older persons; and


14
                                                                                         A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


     creating favourable conditions to assist victims. Older persons are also defined as a
     particularly vulnerable group in the Resolution on the National Programme for the Prevention
     of Domestic Violence and Violence against Women 2024–2029. In addition to linking
     actions across different sectors, the purpose is to identify and ensure effective measures to
     reduce violence against older persons.
     113. In 2023, the Dementia Management Strategy until 2030 was adopted to facilitate a
     coordinated and integrated approach by all stakeholders to tackle dementia and related
     conditions.
     114. In 2023, the Mobile Heroes project was implemented, with two field teams providing
     digital literacy training to people aged 55+ in rural areas. The project continues in 2024.


M.   Human trafficking
     (Recommendations 78–86, 174–181)

     115. Slovenia will continue its activities on the prevention of human trafficking and the
     fight against it as per the 2021–2022 Action Plan for Combating Trafficking in Human
     Beings.37 Victims of human trafficking will continue to enjoy the protection and assistance
     in accordance with the Act ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on Action against
     Trafficking in Human Beings and the Manual on identification, assistance and protection of
     victims.
     116. In 2023, an amendment to the Compensation to Crime Victims Act came into force,
     extending the right to compensation to third-country nationals. In addition, it introduces the
     possibility for beneficiaries to waive their right to legal recourse and thus obtain
     compensation more quickly.
     117. The amended Criminal Code of 2023 transposed the provisions of Directive
     2011/36/EU on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its
     victims. Begging and slavery-like relationships are added as forms of exploitation.
     118. The Government funds assistance programmes for human trafficking victims
     implemented by NGOs selected through public calls for applications. The Crisis
     Accommodation Programme provides a 30-day period of recovery and reflection. During the
     crisis accommodation period, victims are offered longer-term assistance and accommodation
     through the Safe Accommodation Programme. From 2022, victims of the crime of
     exploitation through prostitution also have the right to safe accommodation. The project
     (Re)integration of Human Trafficking Victims was launched in 2019.
     119. Slovenia is committed to raising awareness among migrants and vulnerable groups by
     informing applicants for international protection about the dangers of trafficking and
     exploitation, and preventive and protective measures (PATS project).
     120. In 2021, a systematic and long-term awareness-raising campaign on the dangers of
     human trafficking was launched for children in all primary and secondary schools. Every
     year on European Day Against Human Trafficking, projects are launched to raise awareness
     among the general public and vulnerable groups, with a focus on identifying different forms
     of exploitation.
     121. In cooperation with the UNHCR, the Ministry of the Interior, the Council of Europe
     and the Ključ Society organised the “Preventing, Fighting and Responding to Human
     Trafficking in the Context of Asylum and Migration” conference in 2023. As part of the
     National Roma Platform, Slovenia participates in the SIFOROMA5 and SIFOROMA6
     training projects for officials and others on addressing early and forced marriage in the Roma
     community.
     122. Slovenia will continue its efforts to promote training with a gender and children’s
     rights perspective for officials and professionals who will come into contact with victims,
     and raise awareness among local professionals in areas with a high risk of exploitation of
     trafficked persons. Professional training has been provided to registrars in administrative
     units, as they may encounter forced marriage in the course of their work.



                                                                                                          15
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           123. Guidelines for Labour Inspectors on the Identification of Victims of Trafficking in
           Human Beings were published in 2022. The guidelines are designed to help inspectors detect
           and identify victims of human trafficking exploited for labour.
           124. Slovenia continues to strive for a coordinated collection of statistical information by
           law enforcement authorities, ministries and NGOs. In 2018, the Ministry of the Interior
           strengthened its institutional structure to combat human trafficking by establishing a special
           Anti-Trafficking Service. It provides expert support to the national coordinator for combating
           human trafficking and is responsible for inter-ministerial coordination.
           125. The 2019 Act Amending the Social Assistance Act stipulates that anyone who is a
           victim of a crime committed in Slovenia, regardless of whether they reported the crime or
           not, may be eligible for this support service.38
           126. To strengthen cooperation with the countries of origin of victims of human trafficking,
           protocols on cooperation in the fight against human trafficking and child abuse were signed
           with North Macedonia and Montenegro in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The protocols cover
           areas related to the prevention of human trafficking, the identification, referral, protection
           and voluntary return of victims of human trafficking, and the protection of children who are
           victims of all forms of abuse.


      N.   Migration and international protection
           (Recommendations 98, 144–146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 206–214)

           127. The new Government Strategy on Immigration, adopted in 2024, follows the
           community-based approach like the 2023 Integration Strategy. One of its strategic objectives
           is to protect the life and dignity of migrants, including the protection of all vulnerable
           categories of migrants. The key objective of the integration strategy is to create conditions
           that enable individuals to function with dignity, autonomy and independence and to feel part
           of the Slovenian society.
           128. In times of increased migration flows, the work of the relevant services is also
           coordinated according to the contingency plans. The new immigration strategy also provides
           for a contingency plan for persons under temporary protection. In the new financial
           perspective, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund programmes will support
           vulnerable persons.
           129. Staff training on asylum issues is provided on a needs-based approach. Regarding
           training, inter-ministerial cooperation and coordination is essential, as well as cooperation
           with international organisations. In 2022 and 2023, a training programme entitled
           ”Recognising stereotypes, overcoming prejudice and eliminating discrimination in a
           multicultural society” was organised for police officers and staff, with the aim of providing
           the knowledge to identify and understand different forms of discrimination and specific traits
           of different multicultural communities. The training also shares models of good practice and
           successful problem solving. Specific topics are also included in the Police College courses
           Ethics and human rights and Police in society.
           130. As for the Slovenian Armed Forces, topics on respect for human rights are included
           in training programmes, especially before deployment on international missions and other
           tasks involving contact with the civilian population. The Slovenian Armed Forces are
           committed to including education on the human rights of migrants and refugees in their
           training programmes, which are often tailored to the current situation.
           131. According to the International Protection Act, officials whose tasks fall under the Act
           must receive regular training. In this context, the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund
           provides for supervision and the EUAA 39 offers ongoing training (e.g. on communication,
           conflict resolution, vulnerability). The Judicial Training Centre conducts free training and
           testing for refugee counsellors following their appointment. It also provides training to
           judiciary and judicial staff on refugee, asylum and migration law. In addition, training is
           available for interpreters involved in international protection procedures and for legal
           representatives of unaccompanied minors.



16
                                                                                           A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


     132. International protection procedures always take into account the principle of the best
     interests of the child. Slovenia provides access to healthcare, social protection and education
     under the International Protection Act, which is compliant with the EU asylum legislation.
     The family reunification procedures governed by the Foreigners Act are also in line with EU
     legislation.
     133. In Slovenia, migrant integration is regulated by the International Protection Act, the
     Foreigners Act and the Temporary Protection of Displaced Persons Act. Under the
     International Protection Act, applicants for international protection have access to all levels
     of education, are provided with accommodation and have access to essential healthcare
     services; additional health services are available to women and, following a decision by a
     special commission, to other applicants.
     134. Children are entitled to the same health services as children who are Slovenian
     citizens. In 2023, the Decree on providing appropriate accommodation, care and treatment of
     unaccompanied minors was adopted, which establishes three accommodation facilities,
     namely a reception centre, a housing unit and a youth residence. The first two facilities
     provide a 24-hour service.
     135. The Foreigners Act, amended in 2023, and its by-laws provide for free Slovenian
     language classes and courses on Slovenian society for all third-country nationals.40 The
     amended Employment, Self-employment and Work of Foreigners Act of 2023 gives
     applicants for international protection the right to access the labour market three months after
     submitting the application. In Asylum Centre branches, counselling groups offer applicants
     for international protection the space and opportunity to present their problems and receive
     advice and support.
     136. In accordance with the Rules on the procedure for foreigners who wish to apply for
     international protection in the Republic of Slovenia and on the procedure for accepting
     applications for international protection, any person wishing to apply for international
     protection is informed about the further course of the preliminary procedure and other matters
     before the application is accepted.41
     137. Slovenia respects the principle of non-refoulement as stipulated in the Foreigners Act.
     Furthermore, it ensures that asylum-seekers have access to fair asylum procedures in
     accordance with the International Protection Act and international law, taking into account
     all guaranteed services (information, translation and interpretation, access to UNHCR) and
     by examining each case on its own merits, including its subjective and objective elements.
     The International Protection Act provides for free legal aid in court proceedings, thereby
     ensuring access to legal representation to all asylum seekers.
     138. The conditions for the expulsion of foreigners are laid down in the Criminal Code, the
     Minor Offences Act and the Foreigners Act. Under the Foreigners Act, any expulsion or
     removal of a foreigner must be based on an administrative act against which an appeal is
     possible. Under the same act, victims of illegal employment may be granted a temporary
     residence permit if they are willing to cooperate as witnesses in criminal proceedings or they
     have brought an action against their employer to enforce their employment rights. At a later
     stage, a victim of illegal employment may also be granted a further temporary residence
     permit with a different purpose, if the conditions for this permit are met.
     139. Social activation projects include a specific strand to improve the social and work
     skills of immigrant women from other cultural backgrounds.


III. Challenges in the field of human rights
     140. The human rights challenges facing Slovenia include migration-related issues
     (international protection procedures, asylum issues, prison overcrowding) and hate speech.
     141. Efforts to address migration and international protection issues are described in
     Chapter II.N, hate speech in Chapter II.C and prison overcrowding in Chapter II.D.
     142. Slovenia supports the establishment of regular, safe and orderly migration and the
     comprehensive and effective management of migration flows along migration routes. It


                                                                                                            17
A/HRC/WG.6/48/SVN/1


           remains committed to respecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of migrants and the
           principle of solidarity. It advocates speedy and efficient international protection procedures,
           taking full account of all procedural safeguards. Special attention is paid to protecting and
           safeguarding vulnerable groups. The principle of the best interests of the child is always taken
           into account in procedures involving children.
           143. Slovenia recognises the social harm and unacceptability of hate speech. In this
           context, the key challenges remain: identifying new forms of hate speech, raising awareness
           in society and connecting stakeholders responsible for preventing hate speech. In addition to
           regular training for police officers, new measures are drafted by the Police to adapt their work
           based on an analysis of violations.


     IV. Achievements in the sphere of human rights
           144. In 2024, Slovenia adopted an amendment to the National Assembly Election Act
           abolishing the disenfranchisement of persons under guardianship due to mental and
           psychosocial impairment.
           145. In 2023, an amendment to the Family Code came into force, defining marriage as a
           life union of two persons and no longer as a life union of husband and wife. The same applies
           to the definition of cohabitation as a life union of two persons. The amendment places all
           partners in these unions (including same-sex partners) on an equal footing regarding all the
           legal consequences, including in relation to conditions for adoption.
           146. The fight against impunity for the most serious international crimes, including
           genocide, has long been a priority of Slovenian foreign policy. For over a decade, Slovenia
           was part of the core group of MLA Initiative states (together with Argentina, Belgium,
           Mongolia, the Netherlands and Senegal) and organised the diplomatic conference for the
           adoption of the Convention on mutual legal assistance in Ljubljana in 2023. The Ljubljana-
           The Hague Convention is a landmark treaty designed to help bring justice to the victims of
           genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Convention is expected to
           significantly reduce impunity for perpetrators of international crimes.
           147. Another priority is the nexus between human rights and the environment. On the
           initiative of Slovenia, Costa Rica, Maldives, Morocco and Switzerland, Resolution 48/13 on
           the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (HR2HE) was adopted at the 48th
           session of the UNHRC in 2021 and Resolution (A/76/L.75) at the UNGA42 in 2022.
           148. In 2023, on the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
           Slovenia participated in the Human Rights 75 Initiative with three national voluntary pledges:
           respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in police procedures;
           deinstitutionalisation in the field of mental health; promotion of human rights of older
           persons and prevention of ageism.
           149. Slovenia, together with the above-mentioned countries, presented a collective pledge
           in the field of HR2HE to strengthen efforts for the effective implementation of this right at
           both national and global levels by mainstreaming HR2HE in international forums and
           intergovernmental processes by 2030.


     V. Voluntary pledges and commitments
           150. In the 3rd cycle of the UPR, Slovenia committed to submit a voluntary mid-term report
           on the implementation of the accepted recommendations. The Voluntary Mid-term Report
           was approved by the Government on 17 March 2022 and submitted to the UN OHCHR.


     VI. Conclusion
           151. Slovenia remains committed to the UPR and will continue to participate
           constructively in this mechanism, including in the reviews of Slovenia and other countries,
           with the aim of improving the human rights situation.
