Human Rights Council
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review
Thirty-fourth session
4-15 November 2019


             Summary of Stakeholders’ submissions on Slovenia*

             Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
             Human Rights

       I. Background
             1.    The present report was prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1
             and 16/21, taking into consideration the periodicity of the universal periodic review. It is a
             summary of 11 stakeholders’ submissions1 to the universal periodic review, presented in a
             summarized manner owing to word-limit constraints.


      II. Information provided by stakeholders

      A.     Scope of international obligations2 and cooperation with international
             human rights mechanisms and bodies3

             2.    Joint Submission (JS) 1 reported that Slovenia ratified the Council of Europe
             Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic
             Violence, as recommended4 during the second universal periodic review (UPR).5
             3.     The Human Rights Ombudsman of the Republic of Slovenia (HRORS) and JS2
             noted that Slovenia had not ratified the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of
             Statelessness.6 JS2 and the Commissioner for Human Rights (CoE-Commissioner)
             recommended that Slovenia ratify the 1961 Convention.7
             4.     The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) recommended
             that Slovenia sign and ratify the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
             Weapons.8


      B.     National human rights framework9

             5.   Amnesty International (AI) reported that Parliament amended the Human Rights
             Ombudsman Act in 2017, setting out a legal basis for the Ombudsman Office to apply for

            “A status” under the Paris Principles. 10 HRORS reported that it had already taken steps to
            apply for the accreditation of A status. 11
            6.      JS3 noted that the Council of the Human Rights Ombudsman, an advisory body was
            established in 2018 to ensure plurality and inputs of relevant stakeholders for the
            Ombudsman.12 JS1 noted, however, that no organisation working on the rights of LGBTI
            persons was appointed to be represented in the Council. 13 JS3 noted that a Human Rights
            Centre, another internal organisational unit of the Ombudsman, with a mandate to promote
            human rights and engage in human rights education, did not become operational in January
            2019 due to a lack of financial resources. 14 JS3 noted modest allocations for the expansion
            of the Ombudsman's duties.15
            7.      CoE-Commissioner noted that the equality body in charge of monitoring and
            addressing discrimination, called the Advocate of the Principle of Equality, was
            strengthened by the 2016 the Protection against Discrimination Act. 16 JS1 noted, however,
            that the institution remained underfunded.17 CoE-Commissioner encouraged Slovenia to
            provide the Advocate with additional resources so that he could carry out his mandate
            effectively.18
            8.     JS3 stated that Slovenia lacked a fully operational specialized independent body to
            monitor and promote the realisation of rights of the child in line with its obligations under
            the CRC. An independent mechanism to monitor the implementation of the CRPD was
            lacking as the Council for Persons with Disability did not fulfil the relevant tasks of the
            mechanism and did not have necessary resources to fulfil its mandate. 19 The European
            Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (EU-FRA) noted that the Secretary of the Council
            was performed by an official working full time for a Ministry as an additional task.20


      C.    Implementation of international human rights obligations, taking into
            account applicable international humanitarian law

       1.   Cross-cutting issues

            Equality and non-discrimination21
            9.    EU-FRA noted that Slovenia adopted the Act on Protection against Discrimination,
            subsuming multiple discrimination under a new concept of sever forms of discrimination. 22
            10.    JS3 noted that Slovenia had no anti-discrimination policy and no comprehensive
            policy to prevent and eliminate racism and xenophobia in line with its commitments under
            Durban Declaration (2001).23
            11.     The Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of
            National Minorities (CoE-ACFC) reported that hate speech and intolerant discourse
            increased, in particular online. Hate speech continued to target the Roma, although in more
            subtle forms than in the past, and occasionally other minorities. 24
            12.    The Office of Democratic Institution and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) stated that
            the Criminal Code established that public incitement to hatred, violence or intolerance was
            punishable with imprisonment for up to two years if formulated in a manner that implied
            incitement to public disorder, the use of force or dissemination of ideas on the supremacy
            of one race over another.25 JS3 concluded that the Criminal Code, which considered public
            incitement to hatred an offence only if it constituted a danger to public order did not meet
            requirements of article 4 of the ICERD. 26
            13.    CoE-ACFC stated that Criminal provisions relating to hate speech and hate crimes,
            including offences committed over the internet, had seldom been implemented, and only a
            small number of cases had been prosecuted.27 Additionally, EU-FRA stated that there was
            no general aggravating circumstance for committing criminal offences with a bias
            motivation. EU-FRA reported that there was no specific data collection or statistics
            regarding hate crimes.28
            14.    CoE-ACFC recommended that Slovenia intensified efforts to combat the increase of
            hate speech, particularly in social media, by condemning racially hostile language in the

                                                                                        A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/3


     public domain, strengthen the response of the criminal justice system in cases of hate
     crimes by ensuring that, when sentencing, racist motivation for committing an offence is
     duly taken into account as an aggravating circumstance for all offences, ensure effective
     investigation and appropriate prosecution and punishment of perpetrators, increase public
     awareness of remedies available and enhance training of the police, prosecutors and judges
     on the application of laws.29
     15.    JS1 stated that sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics were not
     explicitly mentioned among the grounds of discrimination in article 14 of the
     Constitution.30 EU-FRA and JS1 noted that the Protection against Discrimination Act
     prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender
     expression.31
     16.     CoE-Commissioner noted that while same-sex marriage was rejected in the 2015
     referendum, Slovenia later adopted a law regulating civil unions, including for same-sex
     couples.32 EU-FRA stated that the law made same-sex registered partnership largely
     equivalent to marriage as of 2017. However, that same-sex partners were not allowed to
     adopt children or entitled to assisted reproduction.33 JS1 recommended that Slovenia amend
     its legislation to allow access to joint adoption for same-sex partners, as well as fertility
     treatment for same-sex couples.34
     17.    JS1 recommended introducing protocols and guidance on legal gender recognition
     and trans affirming health care, based on person’s self-determination and in line with
     international standards and best practices. It recommended improving trans-specific health
     services and eliminating discriminatory and transphobic treatment by medical staff as well
     as the provision of trainings for educational professionals to eliminate gender-based
     discrimination and transphobia and secure safe space for trans individuals within the
     educational system.35
     18.    JS1 recommended that Slovenia continue combating stigma, exclusion and
     discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS.36

     Development, the environment, and business and human rights
     19.    The Group of States against Corruption of the Council of Europe (CoE-GRECO)
     recommended that the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption be provided with
     adequate financial and personnel resources to effectively perform its tasks with respect to
     persons entrusted with top executive functions, in particular in the areas of asset
     declarations, conflicts of interest, lobbying and integrity plans. 37 It recommended ensuring
     timely publication of asset declarations of the ministers and state secretaries and that
     substantive checking of those asset declarations be carried out by the Commission for the
     Prevention of Corruption. 38

2.   Civil and political rights

     Right to life, liberty and security of person39
     20.    HRORS reffered to findings of its 2017 report indicating overcrowding in social
     care institutions and the difficulties faced by persons with mental health problems who
     were placed in those institutions. The necessary amendments to the Social Assistance Act
     and the Menthal Health Act were not yet adopted in order to take measures regarding
     involuntary placement and treatment of people with mental health problems. 40
     21.     AI stated that the legal definition of rape in the Criminal Code was based on force,
     threat of force or coercion, rather than the lack of consent, and was, therefore, not in line
     with international human rights law and standard.41 It recommended that Slovenia revise the
     definition of rape in the Criminal Code so that it is based on the absence of consent.42
     22.     Partnership in Truth for Peace and Reconcilation (PTPR) noted the adoption of the
     2015 Concealed War Graves and Burial of Victims Act introducing explicit reference and
     application of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 to Slovenian policy regarding concealed
     graves and buried victims from 1941–1990.43 In this respect, PTPR recommended ensuring
     that all exhumed victims from mass graves are given a burial in individual graves and that


                                                                                                          3
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/3


           independent monitoring is granted to representative non-governmental organizations
           representing the interest of families of missing victims and religious communities in all
           stages of exhumation of victims from concealed grave sites. 44

           Administration of justice, including impunity, and the rule of law
           23.     The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading
           Treatment or Punishment (CoE-CPT) stated that persons who were not able to pay for a
           lawyer themselves, could, as a rule, not benefit from the presence of a lawyer during police
           questioning. An ex officio lawyer would generally only be appointed if such appointment
           was considered to be “in the interest of justice”. Persons who had an ex officio lawyer
           appointed could only meet him/her briefly before the court hearing and not during police
           questioning. CoE-CPT recommended ensuring that, in practice, all detained persons
           effectively benefit from the right of access to a lawyer from the very outset of their
           deprivation of liberty, if necessary free of charge. A list of ex officio lawyers which
           detained persons could use should be compiled for each police station in consultation with
           the Bar Association.45
           24.    CoE-CPT encouraged Slovenia to continue its efforts to ensure that the national
           standard for living space (7m² of living space per prisoner in a multiple-occupancy cell and
           9m² in a single-occupancy cell46) for prisoners are effectively implemented. 47
           25.    CoE-CPT recommended that Slovenia continue its efforts to provide a satisfactory
           programme of activities to all prisoners in order to ensure that all prisoners spend a
           reasonable part of the day outside their cells engaged in purposeful activities. 48 Noting that
           prisoners held under the reinforced security regime spent the vast majority of the day
           locked in their cells, CoE-CPT recommended that the authorities take decisive steps to
           review the programme of activities offered to those prisoners. 49

           Fundamental freedoms and the right to participate in public and political life 50
           26.    OSCE/ODIHR stated that defamation, slander and insult persisted as criminal
           offences punishable by fines or imprisonment. It recommended that criminal provisions for
           defamation, slander and insult be repealed in favour of civil remedies designed to restore
           the reputation harmed to comply with international standards. 51
           27.    HRORS stated that voters were required to express their intention to vote by mail at
           least 10 days prior to voting. Those persons whose personal liberty were deprived or who
           were hospitalised for medical treatment during the 10-day period were de facto and without
           legal grounds deprived of their right to vote. HRORS put forward specific
           recommendations to the authorities to amend legislation so persons deprived of their liberty
           or admitted to a hospital or social care institution could exercise their right to vote. HRORS
           noted that the Government had proposed relevant legal amendments in 2011, but the
           process of amending legislation had been unsuccessful so far. 52
           28.     OSCE/ODIHR stated that the law should be amended to establish a clear and
           hierarchical system of election dispute resolution pertaining to Election Day procedures and
           to the establishment of election results. To ensure effective legal redress, judicial review of
           relevant decisions of election administration bodies and legal standing for voters or groups
           of voters should be made possible.53

           Prohibition of all forms of slavery54
           29.    The Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE-
           GRETA) stated that Slovenia had continued to be a country of destination and transit of
           victims of trafficking in human beings. 55 Slovenia continued to develop a legal framework
           for combating human trafficking. The use of services provided by a victim of trafficking in
           human beings, with the knowledge that the person concerned was a victim, was
           criminalised. Victims of trafficking holding a temporary residence permit were granted
           access to the labour market.56
           30.   CoE-GRETA considered that Slovenia should step up its efforts in the areas of
           preventing trafficking for the purpose of labour exploitations and of child trafficking. 57

     31.     CoE-GRETA considered that Slovenia should take further steps to ensure that
     human trafficking cases are investigated proactively, prosecuted successfully and result in
     effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.58
     32.     CoE-GRETA urged Slovenia to improve the identification of, and assistance to,
     child victims of trafficking, including by taking steps to address the problem of
     unaccompanied children disappearing by providing suitable safe accommodation and
     trained supervisors. 59 It urged Slovenia to extend the application of the procedural
     protection measures currently reserved to children under the age of 15 years to cover all
     child victims and witnesses of human trafficking up to the age of 18, taking into account the
     best interests of the child.60
     33.    CoE-GRETA urged Slovenia to ensure compliance with the principle of non-
     punishment of victims of human trafficking for their involvement in unlawful activities. 61 It
     urged Slovenia to ensure that access to assistance for victims of human trafficking is not
     made conditional on their co-operation in the investigation and criminal proceedings, and is
     based on their individual needs.62
     34.   CoE-GRETA urged Slovenia to adopt measures to facilitate and guarantee access to
     compensation for victims of trafficking and to ensure that the victims are systematically
     informed in a language that they can understand of the right to seek compensation and the
     procedures to be followed. 63

3.   Economic, social and cultural rights

     Right to an adequate standard of living64
     35.    CoE-Commissioner noted that the groups at greatest risk of poverty were children
     growing up in vulnerable families, older persons – particularly older women – and the long-
     term unemployed and working poor. He recommended that anti-poverty policies and
     programmes pay specific attention to the rights of the child, refrain from pension reforms
     that would result in increased poverty among older persons and adopt specific strategies to
     fight poverty among the long-term unemployed and the working poor.65
     36.    CoE-Commissioner invited Slovenia to consider the fight against poverty not only
     as a social policy issue but in the context of a human rights-based approach, which would
     also include consultation with the groups concerned on policy measures and a qualitative
     assessment of the outcomes of anti-poverty policies.66
     37.    The European Committee of Social Rights (CoE-ECSR) stated that the supply of
     non-profit housing was inadequate and that the average waiting period for allocation of
     non-profit rental housing was too long.67 JS3 noted that third-country nationals (non-EU
     members) had not access to non-profit housing. It noted discrimination against foreigners
     by rental services.68
     38.     AI noted the adoption of an amendment to the Constitution in 2016 establishing the
     right to water as a constitutional right. However, concrete legislation to fulfil this right had
     yet to be adopted.69 CoE-Commissioner stated that this constitutional right needed to be
     made effective in practice for Roma communities. 70

     Right to health71
     39.    HRORS noted existing long waiting lists for health services. HRORS expressed its
     view that more attention should be paid to the organisation of work of health care providers
     as some of them achieved much better results in the same conditions as others and that a
     new act on health care and health insurance could have a significant impact on the
     accessibility of health services.72

4.   Rights of specific persons or groups

     Women73
     40.   OSCE/ODIHR reported that women comprised only 23 per cent in the newly elected
     National Assembly in 2018.74

                                                                                                             5
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/3


           41.    La Manif Pour Tous (LMPT) expressed concerns about the use of surrogacy.75

           Children76
           42.     CoE-ECSR noted in 2015 that not all forms of corporal punishment were prohibited
           in the home.77

           Persons with disabilities78
           43.    OSCE/ODIHR stated that all citizens who were 18 years or older on election day
           had the right to vote, unless their suffrage rights have been revoked by an individualized
           court decision on the basis of mental disability, which was contrary to international
           standards. OSCE/ODIHR recommended that all restrictions to the right to vote which are
           based on mental disability should be removed to ensure equal suffrage and to comply with
           international standards.79
           44.     OSCE/ODIHR noted a general lack of digital accessibility of information and
           communication technology tailored to persons with disability and a lack of accessible
           information and communication for persons with sensory, psychosocial and intellectual
           disabilities, such as large print and easy-to-read formats. Some organisations of persons
           with disabilities shared the opinion that e-voting could provide a viable alternative for
           disabled voters to exercise their suffrage rights without assistance. 80
           45.    OSCE/ODIHR recommended that Slovenia consider reviewing the safeguards for
           alternative voting mechanisms outside regular polling stations on election day, in particular
           for homebound voting and give further consideration to the use of large print and easy-to-
           read ballots, as well as the enhanced use of the Slovenian sign language for the persons
           with sensory and mental disabilities during the electoral process. 81

           Minorities82
           46.    CoE-ACFC reported that Slovenia afforded a high level of protection to the Italian
           and Hungarian national minorities. In ethnically mixed areas, persons belonging to those
           minorities continued to enjoy a broad range of individual rights, as well as a degree of
           autonomy and collective rights exercised in the self-governing communities. The
           implementation of the legal framework, however, was not fully satisfactory. For instance,
           the use of language in public spaces at local level and the quality of education offered in
           minority languages had not been fully respected. 83 JS384 and OSCE/ODIHR85 made similar
           observations.
           47.    CoE-ACFC noted that persons belonging to the “nations of Albanians, Bosniaks,
           Montenegrins, Croats, Macedonians and Serbs” in the former Yugoslavia, and the German-
           speaking ethnic community benefited from some support in the fields of culture, media,
           language and education. However, the measures taken were considered unsatisfactory by
           those communities and they considered that the lack of formal recognition as national
           minorities prevented the full enjoyment of their rights. 86
           48.    CoE-ACFC stated that persons belonging to the Roma community had access to
           special rights provided for in the Roma Community Act.87 CoE-Commissioner stated that
           the Roma was recognised as a minority community with particular ethnic and cultural
           characteristics that might enjoy special protection. However, the Roma were not recognised
           as a national minority.88
           49.     Furthermore, AI stated that the difference in legal definition between the so-called
           “autochthonous”, or traditionally settled, and “non-autochthonous” Roma population, and
           their ability to exercise or access specific rights under the Constitution, remained significant
           obstacles for meaningful Roma integration. Under the Roma Community Act, the “non-
           autochthonous” Roma had no status and no specific rights that were otherwise guaranteed
           to the “autochthonous” Roma. This legal distinction had affected the ability of large Roma
           communities from enjoying their political rights. 89
           50.    OSCE/ODIHR noted that the Roma community had special participation rights in
           local government, but not at the national level. 90 JS3 stated that the Local Self-Government
           Act listed municipalities where Roma minority was autochthonous and had the right to at

least one council member. The system completely ignored Sinti as well as “non-
autochthonous” Roma community with significant numbers present in certain
municipalities.91
51.     AI recommended that Slovenia remove the distinction in legislation and other
measures between “autochthonous” and “non-autochthonous” Roma communities. 92 CoE-
ACFC reiterated its call on the central authorities to improve participation and
representation of all Roma in decision making at local level, in particular in those areas
inhabited by Roma in substantial numbers.93 With a view to strengthening Roma
participation in decision making, CoE-ACFC called on the authorities to create conditions
for the effective functioning of the Roma Community Council, including by revising the
rules on its functioning and its composition which should reflect the diversity amongst the
Roma.94
52.  AI stated that discrimination against and social exclusion of a large proportion of the
Roma community continued, especially in the southeast of the country.95 CoE-
Commissioner and CoE-ACFC made similar observations.96
53.     CoE-Commissioner was concerned to see that long-standing problems in the area of
housing had not been resolved.97 CoE-ACFC stated that measures to promote equality for
Roma had been taken within the framework of the National Programme of Measures for
Roma for 2010–2015. Those measures brought about some progress as regards the
legalisation of Roma settlements and the provision of basic services to these settlements.
Nonetheless, particularly in the south-east of the country, some Roma communities
continued to live in substandard settlements deprived of access to basic amenities and the
municipalities eschew their responsibility to provide durable solutions. 98
54.    CoE-Commissioner stated that the majority of Roma lived in settlements that were
isolated from the rest of the population, outside cities or at the peripheries of inhabited
areas. Many of the settlements were built illegally on municipal or private land, or
sometimes on land that was not zoned for residential use. The illegal status of the
settlements signified a lack of security of tenure, exposing Roma communities living in
those settlements to a risk of eviction. 99
55.     Despite some efforts made by the authorities, the European Commission against
Racism and Intolerance (CoEECRI) was concerned that the lack of practical access to a
safe water supply continued to be a problem for many Roma. 100 In 2017, CoE-ECRI
concluded that its recommendation made in 2014 to ensure that all Roma have practical
access to a safe water supply had not been implemented. 101 AI explained that Roma had to
collect water from nearby streams in some parts of the country, often polluted with sewage,
or from petrol stations or cemeteries.102 HRORS103 and CoE-Commissioner 104 made similar
observations.
56.     AI concluded that the persistent challenges in accessing water and adequate
sanitation, as well as the pervasive poverty among many Roma families, constituted a
serious impediment to their greater social inclusion and the full realization of their human
rights.105
57.    CoE-Commissioner recommended that the central authorities urgently work with
local municipalities to resolve the situation of settlements with substandard living
conditions, in consultation with their inhabitants.106 AI recommended that Slovenia adopt
measures to confer security of tenure to Roma people living in informal settlements and to
ensure full access to water, sanitation and electricity for all Roma communities. 107
58.    CoE-Commissioner stated that while segregation had been prohibited, some de facto
segregation remained. This was the case in pre-schools. Roma children were sometimes
sent to special needs classes in regular schools, in particular for additional learning
sessions. Roma children reportedly continued to be overrepresented in special needs
schools.108 Likewise, AI noted that Roma children continued to be overrepresented in
special needs schools and as recipients of integrated special needs assistance in mainstream
schools.109
59.     AI stated that the authorities had been funding various measures targeted at Roma
pupils, such as the establishment of a number of outreach pre-school education centres and

                                                                                                    7
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/3


           the appointment of Roma assistants. While such measures were envisaged to help integrate
           Roma children into primary school, it was doubtful that these pre-school centres, which
           operated solely in the Roma settlements and exclusively served children of Roma ethnicity,
           genuinely facilitated their integration. Rather, they risked contributing to de-facto long-
           term segregation.110
           60.    CoE-Commissioner welcomed the strong emphasis on improving access to
           education for Roma children and encouraged Slovenia to augment those efforts. He called
           on the authorities to facilitate access of Roma children to one year of regular pre-school,
           which should be free of charge and facilitated through sponsored transportation and the
           presence of Roma assistants in the regular kindergartens. Moreover, CoE-Commissioner
           urged Slovenia to address the issue of over representation of Roma children in special
           classes or schools, which could reveal a pattern of discrimination against them. 111
           61.     CoE-Commissioner was concerned to learn about instances of forced and early
           marriages as well as early pregnancies among the Roma population.112 He recommended
           that legislation be amended in order to clearly specify that the minimum age of marriage is
           18, with exceptions only for persons 16 years of age and older, upon authorisation by a
           judge. The authorities should ensure that those who participate in or aid and abet the
           contracting of forced or child marriage are held accountable and punished in accordance
           with the law.113
           62.     Welcoming the adoption of the National Programme of Measures for Roma for
           2017-2021114 CoE-Commissioner invited the government to formulate a clear strategy for
           the improvement of the situation of Roma, including through the identification of concrete
           targets.115
           63.     CoE-Commissioner noted that the collection of data on the situation of Roma was
           critical to better target policies, and could be done while respecting the confidentiality of
           personal data.116 The authorities should collect accurate and updated information on the
           situation of Roma, disaggregated by gender and age, particularly in the areas of housing,
           education, employment and health care, with a view to increasing the effectiveness of
           existing and future policies.117

           Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers118
           64.    CoE-ECSR concluded that migrant workers might be expelled in situations where
           they did not endanger national security or offend against public interest or morality and
           they had no independent right of appeal against a deportation order. Equal treatment was
           not secured for migrant workers with respect to access to housing, and in particular to
           assisted rental schemes and subsidies.119
           65.    AI stated that many asylum-seekers irregularly entering Slovenia were denied access
           to asylum, fined for irregular entry and forcibly returned – without any procedure and
           frequently in groups. According to the findings of AI, Slovenia frequently ignored asylum-
           seekers’ intention to apply for international protection in 2018. 120
           66.    CoE-CPT had concerns about the new Sections 10a and 10b of the Aliens Act,
           enacted by the Parliament in 2017, which introduced the possibility for the Parliament to
           activate – under exceptional circumstances and for a limited period of time – a “measure in
           response to mass migration”. It would appear that this provision would deny foreign
           nationals the possibility to apply for asylum under the International Protection Act without
           an individual assessment of the case. The procedure did not foresee a hearing of the foreign
           national and an appeal against the denial would not have a suspensive effect. Consequently,
           the CoE-CPT had concerns as to whether foreign nationals would in practice be effectively
           protected against refoulement, including chain refoulement. In addition, Section 10b could
           be considered as authorising collective expulsions which were prohibited under the
           European Convention on Human Rights.121 AI expressed similar concerns. 122
           67.    CoE-Commissioner regretted the adoption in January 2017 of legislative
           amendments to the Aliens Act which lacked appropriate guarantees against refoulement and
           safeguards for the rights of everyone to seek and enjoy asylum. He urged Slovenia not to
           activate the amendments.123

                                                                                     A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/3


68.     AI recommended that Slovenia ensure that all asylum-seekers had access to fair and
effective asylum procedures in accordance with the Slovenian International Protection Act
and international law and conduct prompt, independent and impartial investigations into all
allegations of denial of access to asylum procedures, pushbacks and collective
expulsions.124
69.    AI recommended that Slovenia refrain from returning persons to other countries
without providing procedural safeguards against returns that could put people at risk of
human rights violations in the country to which they may be directly or indirectly
returned.125
70.     CoE-CPT noted that amendments of the Aliens Act have introduced an obligatory ex
officio review of the detention order within the first three months of detention. However,
CoE-CPT noted that in the process of examining an appeal against the detention decision or
during the ex officio review of such a decision, the foreign nationals concerned were very
rarely heard in person and that the relevant legal provisions did not include the obligation to
hold such a hearing. CoE-CPT recommended that the judicial review of the detention order
always included an obligatory hearing of the foreign national concerned.126
71.     CoE-CPT noted that according to the Aliens Act, foreign nationals detained under
aliens legislation had the right of access to a lawyer. However, it was concerned that the
law did not guarantee free legal aid for those who were not in a position to pay for a lawyer
themselves.127
72.    AI stated that the authorities continued the practice of detention of unaccompanied
children. Despite a 2016 government decision providing that unaccompanied children,
regardless of their migration status, should be accommodated in alternative accommodation
in student dormitories, official data indicated that in 2018, at least 300 children were
detained in the Centre for Foreigners in Postojna.128
73.    AI recommended that Slovenia stop the detention of children and families with
children solely on the grounds of their migration status, and replace this by child-sensitive
non-institutionalized care solutions. 129 CoE-Commissioner urged Slovenia to develop a
clear roadmap for the complete abolition of detention of minor migrants and asylum
seekers, including unaccompanied migrant children. He urged Slovenia to ensure that
unaccompanied migrant children were accommodated separately from adults and that
asylum applications by unaccompanied migrant children were accorded priority and
handled in a swift manner.130
74.     CoE-Commissioner urged Slovenia to make some systemic adjustments to ensure
that the country was prepared to handle increasing numbers of asylum applicants. The
quality of the services available to asylum seekers and refuges should be improved, and the
length of asylum procedures should be shortened. 131 He encouraged the authorities to
consider pre-integration measures for asylum seekers, including language courses and
earlier access to the labour market, notably for those coming from countries with high
recognition rates.132

Stateless persons133
75.     JS2 noted that Slovenia had no dedicated statelessness determination procedure. 134
CoE-Commissioner recommended that Slovenia develop an accessible, efficient and
centralised statelessness determination procedure.135 Furthermore, JS2 recommended
amending the law to bring the definition of a stateless person in national law in line with the
definition provided in the 1954 Convention.136
76.     JS2 stated that safeguards in national law to prevent statelessness among children
born in Slovenia relied on the status of the parents rather than the child. The parents of a
stateless child born on the territory must also be stateless for the child to acquire Slovenian
nationality.137 CoE-Commissioner concluded that given the current legislation, there was a
risk of statelessness of children of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees born en route or
in Slovenia. He urged Slovenia to ensure that children born en route to or in Slovenia of
parents who could not transmit their nationality be granted Slovenian nationality shortly
after birth, so as to prevent cases of statelessness among such children. 138


                                                                                                       9
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/3


             77.     CoE-Commissioner stated that without legal status, the “erased” (the term referred
             to members of the population who were eliminated from the official residence registry in
             the period following the 1991 independence of Slovenia) were deprived of their economic,
             social, civil and political rights. Those affected were left without access to health services,
             education, employment and social benefits, and had no legal remedy to challenge those
             violations. Thousands were forcibly removed from the country or denied re-entry. Others
             did not leave for fear of not being allowed to come back and were thus trapped in a legal
             limbo.139 CoE-GRETA noted that the persons concerned became vulnerable, including to
             becoming victims of human trafficking. 140
             78.     JS2 stated that despite accepted recommendations of the previous UPR to address
             the situation, Slovenia had not taken measures to implement those recommendations and
             facilitate access of the “erased” persons to citizenship.141 CoE-Commissioner noted that the
             President of the National Assembly issued a public apology to the “erased” for the injustice
             and suffering, humiliation and slander they had suffered. However, he stated that close to
             12000 “erased” had not regularized their status, including those who were prevented from
             obtaining regularisation either because of the restrictive conditions in the 2010 Legal Status
             Act or because they missed the deadline. CoE-Commissioner noted that representatives of
             “erased” considered that the amount of compensation did not adequately cover the actual
             losses and damages suffered.142
             79.     CoE-Commissioner recommended that the authorities provide a way for those
             “erased” who have not been able to regularise their status and wish to integrate into
             Slovenian society to do so, especially those who are living in Slovenia with no legal
             status.143 CoE-ACFC and JS2 made similar recommendations. 144
