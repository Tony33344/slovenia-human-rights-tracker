Human Rights Council
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review
Thirty-fourth session
4–15 November 2019


            Compilation on Slovenia

            Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
            Human Rights

       I. Background
            1.     The present report was prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1
            and 16/21, taking into consideration the periodicity of the universal periodic review. It is a
            compilation of information contained in reports of treaty bodies and special procedures and
            other relevant United Nations documents, presented in a summarized manner owing to
            word-limit constraints.


      II. Scope of international obligations and cooperation with
          international human rights mechanisms and bodies1, 2
            2.     It was recommended that Slovenia ratify the International Convention on the
            Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the
            International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, 3
            the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
            Rights 4 and the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 5 The Committee on
            Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that Slovenia ratify the Equality of
            Treatment (Social Security) Convention, 1962 (No. 118) of the International Labour
            Organization (ILO).6
            3.   In 2017, Slovenia submitted its midterm report regarding the implementation of the
            recommendations made during its second universal periodic review. 7
            4.  Slovenia contributed financially to the Office of the United Nations High
            Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2017 and 2018.8


    III. National human rights framework9
            5.     In 2016, the Human Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia establish a fully
            functioning and independent national human rights institution with a broad-based human
            rights mandate and provide it with adequate resources, in line with the principles relating to
            the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the
            Paris Principles).10 The Special Rapporteur on minority issues noted the adoption in 2017 of

GE.19-14870(E)


A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


            amendments to the Human Rights Ombudsman Act, setting out a new legal basis for the
            Office of the Ombudsman to apply for A status under the Paris Principles. 11
            6.     The Special Rapporteur on minority issues noted the adoption of the Protection from
            Discrimination Act of 2016, which resulted in the office of the Advocate of the Principle of
            Equality becoming an independent State body. The mandate included investigative and
            decisional powers to order the end of discriminatory practices, although no direct punitive
            powers.12
            7.     The Special Rapporteur recommended that Slovenia adopt multi-year funding
            formulas for both the Office of the Ombudsman and the Advocate of the Principle of
            Equality that properly reflected their current or expanded mandates. 13


    IV. Implementation of international human rights obligations,
        taking into account applicable international humanitarian
        law

      A.    Cross-cutting issues

       1.   Equality and non-discrimination14
            8.      The ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and
            Recommendations noted the lack of a comprehensive strategy for non-discrimination,
            including the absence of a policy against racism. 15 The Human Rights Committee and the
            Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that Slovenia adopt a
            comprehensive anti-discrimination strategy, in consultation with civil society
            representatives.16 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recommended
            that Slovenia explicitly incorporate into its anti-discrimination legislation, policies and
            strategies the recognition of multiple and intersectional discrimination based on sex, age,
            ethnic background or sexual orientation or on migrant, asylum-seeking, refugee, disability
            or any other status.17
            9.     The Human Rights Committee expressed concern that hate speech on the Internet,
            including in online forums, was on the rise, particularly against migrants, Roma, lesbian,
            gay, bisexual and transgender persons and Muslims. 18 The Committee was also concerned
            about the use of racist and xenophobic rhetoric by politicians towards persons belonging to
            minority groups, including migrants and refugees. 19 The Committee on the Elimination of
            Racial Discrimination expressed concern about reports of a lack of action in response to the
            use of racist and xenophobic rhetoric by political figures and the existence of organizations
            promoting racial hatred and violence.20
            10.     The Special Rapporteur on minority issues noted that while article 297 of the Penal
            Code addressed hate speech, its provisions had traditionally been interpreted in a narrow,
            restrictive way. Consequently, very few cases had led to prosecution and conviction. 21
            11.   The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that
            Slovenia strengthen the response of its criminal justice system in cases of racist hate speech
            and racially motivated violence by ensuring effective investigation and appropriate
            prosecution and punishment of perpetrators. The Committee also recommended that
            Slovenia amend its criminal code to specifically recognize racist motives as an aggravating
            circumstance for all crimes and offences. 22
            12.    The Special Rapporteur on minority issues stated that, in order to counter hate
            speech and incitement to violence against minorities more effectively, a clearer picture of
            which minorities were targeted, by whom and how was necessary. He recommended that
            disaggregated data on those matters be collated and published by the responsible
            authorities.23
            13.    The Human Rights Committee regretted that the amendments to the Law on
            Marriage and Family Relations granting, on an equal basis, the rights of same-sex couples
            to inherit, to access reproductive treatments and to adopt children were made subject to a

     referendum in December 2015 notwithstanding the provisions of the Constitution to the
     contrary, and that they were rejected.24
     14.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia ensure that all lesbian, gay,
     bisexual and transgender persons were guaranteed equal rights and that it intensify its
     efforts to combat stereotypes and prejudice against such persons, including by launching a
     nationwide awareness-raising campaign in cooperation with civil society organizations. 25
     Likewise, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that
     Slovenia explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.26

2.   Development, the environment, and business and human rights
     15.    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights encouraged Slovenia to
     gradually increase its official development assistance with a view to achieving the
     international commitment of 0.7 per cent of its gross national product and to pursue a
     human rights-based approach in its development cooperation policy. 27 In 2015, Slovenia
     noted that it had been supporting a human rights-based approach to development
     internationally.28
     16.    The same Committee recommended that Slovenia address the root causes of
     corruption and adopt all necessary policy and legislative measures to combat corruption and
     related impunity effectively and to ensure that public affairs were conducted, in law and in
     practice, in a transparent manner. It also recommended that Slovenia guarantee protection
     of the human rights of those engaged in anti-corruption activities, in particular victims,
     whistle-blowers, witnesses and their lawyers. 29


B.   Civil and political rights

1.   Right to life, liberty and security of person30
     17.    The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was concerned at the
     reported cases of excessive use of force against persons in psychiatric institutions by
     judicial police officers and medical staff and about the use of electroconvulsive therapy on
     persons with disabilities.31
     18.    The Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
     Rights were concerned about the high prevalence of domestic violence in Slovenia and the
     limited effectiveness of mechanisms to protect victims of domestic violence, including the
     non-enforcement of restraining orders issued against alleged perpetrators. 32
     19.     The Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons
     stated that elder abuse was a recognized problem in Slovenia and that the most common
     forms of violence were neglect and physical and psychological abuse. 33 She called on the
     Government to devise a comprehensive strategy for the protection of older persons from
     violence and all forms of abuse, and encouraged it to ensure that elder abuse was prevented,
     detected and reported at all levels and in all settings and that cases of elder abuse were
     investigated and prosecuted.34

2.   Administration of justice, including impunity, and the rule of law35
     20.    The Human Rights Committee remained concerned at reports of a large backlog of
     cases in the labour and social courts. It expressed concern at the lengthy duration of court
     proceedings and the lack of timely and effective access to free legal aid in criminal
     proceedings where the interests of justice so required. The Committee recommended that
     Slovenia adopt a comprehensive strategy to address the backlog of cases throughout the
     judiciary and ensure the right to a fair trial without undue delay. It also recommended that
     Slovenia ensure that free legal aid was available in criminal proceedings without undue
     delay to all those who did not have sufficient means to pay for it.36
     21.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia expedite efforts to improve the
     living conditions in detention facilities in line with the International Covenant on Civil and
     Political Rights and the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of


                                                                                                           3
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


            Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules). It recommended that Slovenia consider not only the
            construction of new prison facilities, but also the wider application of alternative non-
            custodial sentences, such as electronic monitoring, parole and community service. 37

       3.   Fundamental freedoms38
            22.    The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
            noted that defamation continued to be a criminal offence under the Penal Code. 39 The
            Human Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia reconsider decriminalizing
            defamation and restrict the application of criminal law to the most serious cases.40

       4.   Prohibition of all forms of slavery41
            23.    The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern
            about the low rates of investigation and conviction in cases of human trafficking and the
            lack of adequate mechanisms to identify, protect and rehabilitate victims of trafficking. 42
            The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended that
            Slovenia investigate, prosecute and punish all cases of trafficking in persons and ensure that
            the sentences imposed on perpetrators were commensurate with the gravity of the crime.
            The Committee recommended that Slovenia strengthen measures to identify and provide
            support to women at risk of trafficking, in particular Roma, migrant, refugee and asylum-
            seeking women, and measures aimed at addressing the root causes of trafficking. 43
            24.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
            that Slovenia provide victims of trafficking with adequate access to health care and
            counselling and ensure that all victims of trafficking obtained effective protection and
            redress, including rehabilitation and compensation. 44 The Human Rights Committee
            recommended that Slovenia ensure that victims of trafficking were provided with adequate
            assistance regardless of whether they cooperated with law enforcement authorities in
            investigations and criminal proceedings. 45


      C.    Economic, social and cultural rights

       1.   Right to work and to just and favourable conditions of work
            25.     The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights reiterated its concern about
            the high levels of unemployment in Slovenia, particularly affecting youth, persons with
            disabilities and persons belonging to ethnic minorities, and expressed concern about the
            continuous job insecurity faced by short-term contract workers.46 The Committee on the
            Elimination of Discrimination against Women was concerned about the disproportionately
            high unemployment rate among women. 47

       2.   Right to social security
            26.    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that
            Slovenia revise the eligibility conditions and rates for social security benefits, while taking
            into account the actual cost of living in Slovenia and paying particular attention to
            unemployed persons, persons with disabilities and older persons. 48

       3.   Right to an adequate standard of living49
            27.     The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was concerned about the
            increasing risk of poverty faced by especially disadvantaged and marginalized groups such
            as older persons. The Committee was also concerned at regional disparities in poverty
            levels, with the eastern and south-eastern regions being most affected by poverty. 50
            28.     The Independent Expert on older persons stated that institutional care for older
            people remained predominant. Institutional care was understaffed and those taking care of
            older persons had inadequate training. 51 The Independent Expert encouraged Slovenia to
            pursue the process of deinstitutionalization of care and to prepare an action plan for
            deinstitutionalization, including the parallel development of community-based services in
            consultation with civil society, local communities and older persons themselves.

     Community-based services had to be tailored to the needs of older persons in full respect of
     their physical, psychological, social and cultural condition.52
     29.    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was concerned that
     citizens of non-European countries were not eligible for social housing in Slovenia, that in
     practice refugees did not enjoy access to social housing, and that, owing to insufficient
     availability of accessible housing, persons with disabilities were often placed in institutions.
     The Committee urged Slovenia to repeal any discriminatory provisions from the Housing
     Act, and to expedite the process of adopting a housing policy that addressed, inter alia,
     access to social housing by all residents without discrimination and the special housing
     needs of persons with disabilities.53 The Independent Expert on older persons recommended
     that Slovenia adopt a housing policy that took into account the special needs of older
     persons to enable them to live independently. 54

4.   Right to health55
     30.    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that
     Slovenia reform its health insurance system with a view to increasing the proportion of
     essential rights and services covered by the basic health insurance, and ensure that all
     residents had access to basic health insurance without discrimination.56
     31.    The same Committee was concerned that regional disparities in access to health-care
     services persisted, particularly the inadequate numbers of primary health-care experts in
     some of the remote rural areas, and that measures taken to that end were not
     comprehensive. The Committee recommended that Slovenia step up its efforts to provide
     equal access to quality health-care services to all persons in the country. 57
     32.    The Independent Expert on older persons called on Slovenia to ensure the
     availability and accessibility of palliative care for all older persons in need, particularly
     those who suffered from a life-threatening or life-limiting illness.58

5.   Right to education
     33.    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted with concern the
     regional disparities in access to education, including tertiary education, with the eastern
     region of Slovenia being most affected by limited access to education. The Committee
     recommended that Slovenia ensure equal access to quality education for all students.59
     34.    UNESCO recommended that Slovenia allocate sufficient funding to education, in
     line with benchmarks endorsed under Sustainable Development Goal 4. 60


D.   Rights of specific persons or groups

1.   Women61
     35.    The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended
     that Slovenia ensure the effective implementation of the national programme for equal
     opportunities for women and men for the period 2015–2020.62 Furthermore, the Committee
     called for the realization of substantive gender equality throughout the process of
     implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 63
     36.    The same Committee noted with concern the failure to comprehensively prohibit all
     forms of violence against women in both the public and private spheres and the lenient
     sentences imposed by courts on perpetrators of acts of domestic violence. It also noted with
     concern that the network of shelters and crisis centres did not cover the entire territory of
     Slovenia and that free counselling and assistance were not accessible to all women who
     were victims of violence.64
     37.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia amend its legislation to include all
     forms of violence against women in both the public and private spheres. 65 The Human
     Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia strengthen measures aimed at preventing
     and combating violence against women, including domestic violence and sexual abuse, by,
     inter alia, ensuring that victims had access to effective remedies and means of protection,


                                                                                                             5
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


            including police protection, adequate emergency shelters, rehabilitative services, legal
            assistance and other support services and that all cases of violence against women,
            including domestic violence, were thoroughly investigated and that perpetrators were
            prosecuted and were punished with appropriate sanctions. 66
            38.     The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women was concerned
            about the occupational segregation in the labour market, the wage gap in traditionally
            female-dominated sectors and the limited access by women to skilled and better-paid jobs.67
            The Committee recommended that Slovenia adopt and implement policies that reversed
            cultural patterns and transformed traditional gender stereotypes and norms of sex-
            appropriate roles in society transmitted through schooling and parenting, in order to
            eliminate occupational segregation and achieve substantive equality of women and men in
            the labour market. It recommended that Slovenia address the gender pay gap and improve
            access by women to skilled and better-paid jobs, including through the diversification of
            fields of study and vocational training for women and men and boys and girls. 68
            39.    The Committee recommended that Slovenia strengthen awareness-raising and
            education initiatives for both women and men on the sharing of domestic and family
            responsibilities and provide incentives for active participation by men in such tasks, and
            increase the use of paternity leave by fathers and ensure that employers fulfilled the legal
            obligation to make such leave available by introducing compulsory paternity leave. 69
            40.    The Committee also recommended that Slovenia expedite the preparation and
            adoption of temporary special measures to increase the representation of women in
            management and on supervisory boards of companies.70
            41.    The Committee further recommended that Slovenia develop a strategy for the
            protection and promotion of the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and
            provide high-quality and accessible public sexual and reproductive health-care services
            covered by the compulsory health insurance, in particular for adolescent girls and women
            belonging to disadvantaged and marginalized groups, such as women living in poverty,
            women asylum seekers and refugees, Roma women and women who were victims of
            violence.71

       2.   Children72
            42.    In 2018, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities expressed concern
            about the lack of an explicit and comprehensive prohibition of corporal punishment of
            children in all settings. 73 In 2016, the Human Rights Committee recommended that
            Slovenia take practical steps to put an end to corporal punishment in all settings. It
            recommended that Slovenia encourage non-violent forms of discipline as alternatives to
            corporal punishment and conduct public information campaigns to raise awareness about its
            harmful effects.74

       3.   Persons with disabilities75
            43.     The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was concerned about the
            persistence of a paternalistic approach to persons with disabilities underpinned by the
            medical and charity models of disability and about a number of disability definitions that
            were not in compliance with the human rights model of disability, in particular definitions
            that were derogatory or described the “unfitness” of persons to participate in regular
            education, independent life and work on the grounds of their impairment. The Committee
            recommended that Slovenia conduct a review of its national legislation, policies and
            programmes, bring them into line with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of
            Persons with Disabilities, including the various definitions of disability in legislation, and
            align them with the human rights model of disability. 76
            44.    The same Committee recommended that Slovenia adopt a strategy to prevent all
            forms of violence against, and abuse and ill-treatment of, persons with disabilities, in
            particular women with disabilities, and conduct an investigation into all allegations of
            violence and abuse of persons with disabilities in institutions, expedite the investigation of
            suspicious causes of deaths of residents of institutions, provide redress to victims and
            sanction perpetrators. It also recommended that Slovenia adopt a strategy to monitor the

                                                                                            A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


     situation of children with disabilities in alternative care, with a view to identifying all
     instances of violence against children with disabilities. 77
     45.     The same Committee was concerned at the large number of persons with disabilities
     residing in institutions because of the lack of an explicit policy, national and municipal
     capacity and measures for deinstitutionalization of persons with disabilities, and the
     insufficient provision of independent living services in the community. It recommended
     that Slovenia adopt and implement a strategy and action plan aimed at
     deinstitutionalization, provide sufficient funding for developing community-based
     independent living schemes and allocate sufficient resources to ensure that services in the
     community were available, accessible, affordable, acceptable and accommodating for
     persons with disabilities.78
     46.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia ensure the efficiency and
     effectiveness of social protection and poverty reduction programmes for persons with
     disabilities, the accessibility of public housing and the accessibility and availability of
     health services for persons with disabilities, and adopt measures aimed at promoting an
     inclusive, open and accessible labour market in all sectors for all persons with disabilities. 79
     47.    The same Committee was concerned that numerous public buildings and services,
     including public transport, remained inaccessible, especially outside the capital. The
     Committee recommended that Slovenia adopt clear accessibility standards and measures
     providing for sanctions for failure to comply with accessibility standards, develop
     operational measures to ensure the accessibility of transport services and of all buildings
     open to the public and increase budget allocations for such measures, especially in areas
     outside the capital.80
     48.     The Committee recommended that Slovenia adopt a national strategy, with
     benchmarks and with resources, aimed at ensuring the full inclusion of children with
     disabilities in society, paying attention to the development of inclusive settings in early
     assistance, education, housing, health and all community services. 81
     49.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia adopt a strategy and action plan
     for the implementation of inclusive education at all levels for all children with disabilities,
     establish a comprehensive monitoring system to assess the progress of inclusive education,
     and strengthen the capacity of inclusive schools to train teachers in inclusive education,
     curriculum accommodation and teaching methods. 82
     50.     The Special Rapporteur on minority issues stated that Slovenia had generally a
     positive and constructive approach to the use of sign language. He nonetheless urged the
     Government to strengthen and effectively protect the human rights of members of the
     Slovenian deaf community, including by amending or adopting relevant legislation making
     it an official language.83

4.   Minorities84
     51.   The Special Rapporteur on minority issues noted the constitutional distinction
     between autochthonous Italian and Hungarian national communities and other minorities,
     and the special rights of the Roma community. He explained that the Constitution
     recognized two “autochthonous national communities” – Hungarians and Italians – and that
     they were afforded a widely recognized, high level of protection. The “autochthonous”
     Roma were granted special rights under the Constitution and under the 2007 Roma
     Community Act, but those rights were not as extensive as those recognized for the
     Hungarian and Italian communities.85
     52.     The Special Rapporteur stated that although much had been achieved for the
     protection of the rights of minorities, in particular of Hungarians and Italians, too many
     Slovenian citizens belonging to minority groups were left out. He urged Slovenia to
     formulate and adopt comprehensive legislation to better protect the rights of all minorities
     in Slovenia and to ensure that legislation on the rights of minorities included additional
     provisions on education in the minority mother tongue where there was a sufficient demand
     in a locality, to the degree appropriate according to the principle of proportionality, or at
     least provide for teaching of a minority language where possible. 86


                                                                                                              7
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


           53.    The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination remained concerned
           about the lack of representation of minorities, other than the Italian and Hungarian
           minorities, in Parliament and in regional elected bodies. 87 The Committee recommended
           that Slovenia ensure that all minority ethnic groups were adequately represented in
           Parliament and in regional elected bodies, ensure the effective functioning of the Roma
           Community Council, including by revising the rules on its composition and its functions,
           and ensure the actual inclusion and representation of all Roma in municipal councils. 88
           54.     The Special Rapporteur on minority issues stated that the Roma and Sinti
           communities continued to be the most marginalized and vulnerable. 89 The Human Rights
           Committee was concerned that limited progress had been achieved in improving the
           situation of Roma, who continued to suffer from prejudice, discrimination and social
           exclusion. The Committee was concerned about the distinction made by Slovenia between
           “autochthonous” and “non-autochthonous” Roma communities and that only the former
           was granted special rights and opportunities.90
           55.    The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that
           Slovenia ensure the effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the National
           Programme of Measures for Roma for the period 2016–2021.91 The Special Rapporteur on
           minority issues recommended that Slovenia remove the unhelpful, probably harmful and
           possibly discriminatory distinction in legislation and other measures made between
           “autochthonous” and “non-autochthonous” Roma communities.92
           56.      The Independent Expert on older persons stated that most Roma people in Slovenia
           still lived apart from the majority of the population, in isolated settlements, which were
           generally below the minimum living standards.93 The Special Rapporteur on minority issues
           noted that the main obstacle faced by Roma communities was the informal nature of their
           settlements, and consequently their lack of security of tenure with regard to their homes and
           property, which led to restrictions on their rights to adequate housing and to water and
           sanitation.94 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was concerned that
           the majority of Roma who lived in informal settlements were vulnerable to forced
           eviction.95 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was concerned that
           Roma were disproportionally affected by the absence of provisions prohibiting forced
           eviction.96
           57.     The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that
           Slovenia ensure security of tenure for people living in informal settlements, take all
           measures necessary to guarantee that evictions were carried out in accordance with
           international standards, and provide remedies and adequate alternative housing to those
           affected in cases of eviction. 97 The Special Rapporteur on minority issues and the
           Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights made similar recommendations. 98 The
           Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended that Slovenia take
           effective measures to end segregation of Roma communities, prevent acts of discrimination
           against Roma attempting to buy or rent housing outside their segregated areas and facilitate
           access to social housing for Roma. 99
           58.     The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was concerned that
           access by Roma to employment and health services remained limited. A disproportionately
           large number of Roma had poor access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation,
           exposing them to grave health risks.100 The Committee recommended that Slovenia
           guarantee effective access for Roma to public services, such as electricity and health
           services, and to the formal labour market, and step up efforts to provide access to adequate
           sanitation and safe drinking water for the Roma population.101
           59.     The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights expressed its concern that
           the majority of Roma children in primary and secondary school were enrolled in classes for
           children with special needs, that they achieved low school performance and that their
           dropout rate remained high. 102 The Committee recommended that Slovenia adopt effective
           and adequately resourced measures aimed at integrating Roma children into preschool
           institutions, ending school segregation and reducing school dropout.103 The Committee on
           the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that Slovenia continue to adopt
           measures to provide all Roma with effective access to high quality education at all levels. 104

     The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, UNESCO and the ILO
     Committee of Experts made similar recommendations. 105
     60.    The Human Rights Committee was concerned about instances of child and forced
     marriage among members of the Roma community. 106 While welcoming the criminalization
     of child and/or forced marriage, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
     against Women was concerned about the inadequate response by Slovenia with respect to
     the prevention, prosecution and punishment of such offences, especially among the Roma
     population.107 The Human Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia ensure that the
     prohibition of child and forced marriage was implemented in practice. 108

5.   Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers109
     61.    The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was concerned about the
     working conditions of migrant workers, which were characterized by low income and
     unlawful deductions, wage arrears, extra working hours without compensation, short-term
     contracts and subcontracting, lack of social benefits for workers in the informal economy
     and limited access to justice.110
     62.     The Human Rights Committee regretted the measures taken by Slovenia to respond
     to the influx of asylum seekers and migrants, including the adoption, on 18 February 2016,
     of a joint statement of the heads of police services of five European countries, including
     Slovenia, placing limits to entry solely on the basis of nationality and the possession of
     identification documents, rather than on an individual assessment of whether or not
     individuals concerned were in need of protection against non-refoulement.111 The United
     Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed similar concerns. He stated that
     the agreement by the police chiefs established a policy that included measures that seemed
     to be incompatible with the human rights obligations of the countries concerned.112
     63.    The High Commissioner stated that he was particularly troubled that the agreement
     appeared to enable the collective expulsion of non-nationals, acts explicitly prohibited
     under international law. The agreement established extremely narrow criteria for allowing
     entry – “fleeing war” – with no mention of “persecution”, which was the key criteria for
     recognizing refugees under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its
     Protocol and related international law. The agreement contained no measures aimed at
     protecting extremely vulnerable women, children and men on the move. 113
     64.    The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was
     concerned that the amendments to the Act on foreigners that had come into force in 2017
     might undermine the right to seek asylum and protection from refoulement. A new article
     of the Act introduced a possibility for the National Assembly to limit access to the territory
     and asylum procedures in cases of mass influxes of refugees and migrants.114 Moreover, the
     Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern about the
     absence of specific provisions prohibiting refoulement in the international protection act of
     2007.115
     65.     The Human Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia take effective steps to
     allow persons in need of international protection access to the relevant procedures for
     international protection, and ensure that any measures taken by Slovenia, including in
     relation to bilateral and regional agreements, did not discriminate on the basis of country of
     origin, arrival or transit. It also recommended that Slovenia ensure that the procedure for
     international protection allowed for an individual assessment based on the circumstances of
     each case by trained professionals with legal expertise, and that legal representation of
     adequate quality was systematically made accessible throughout the entire procedure for
     requesting international protection. 116 Furthermore, the Committee recommended that
     Slovenia ensure full respect of the principle of non-refoulement.117
     66.     The same Committee recommended that Slovenia ensure adequate living conditions
     in full respect of the right to be protected against inhuman or degrading treatment in all
     refugee camps and shelters, and guarantee access to basic needs, including food, health-care
     services, psychological support and legal counselling. 118




                                                                                                           9
A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


            67.    UNHCR stated that Slovenia did not provide comprehensive protection to children,
            in particular unaccompanied and separated children, because there was no formal
            mechanism in place to consider the best interests of the child in decisions that affected
            them. The guardianship system for unaccompanied children was not effective; in most
            cases the guardians were not trained and had little experience working with foreign
            children.119
            68.   The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that
            Slovenia protect the rights of separated and unaccompanied children seeking asylum in full
            compliance with international standards, including through the introduction of best-interests
            determination procedures and the adoption of the benefit-of-the-doubt standard in the event
            of remaining uncertainty in age assessment. 120
            69.    The same Committee expressed concern about the abrogation in 2013 of the right to
            family reunification in the relevant provisions of the international protection act. 121 The
            Human Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia consider steps to facilitate the
            process of family reunification for beneficiaries of international protection.122
            70.     The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern
            about the lack of free access to adequate secondary and tertiary medical health care and of
            social housing for asylum seekers and refugees. 123 UNHCR noted that asylum seekers had
            access only to basic medical services, and only in exceptional circumstances, following the
            approval of an interdepartmental committee, were they granted specialized treatment.
            Refugees were entitled to rental subsidies for up to three years. Under the national
            legislation, the possibility to apply for social housing was restricted to Slovenian citizens. 124
            71.    The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that
            Slovenia adopt all measures to ensure effective and equal access for asylum seekers and
            refugees to social housing and free public health services and ensure that all migrants,
            asylum seekers and refugees were provided with adequate basic services, shelter and
            humanitarian assistance while in transit in the territory of Slovenia.125

       6.   Stateless persons126
            72.   UNHCR recommended that Slovenia put in place a statelessness determination
            procedure to ensure the protection of stateless persons. 127
            73.     UNHCR stated that the act on citizenship granted citizenship to children born in the
            country when the child’s parents were unknown, their nationality was unknown or when the
            parents were stateless. That safeguard did not prevent children from being born stateless in
            the territory to parents who could not transfer their nationality to their child, as envisaged
            under article 1 of the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. It recommended that
            Slovenia amend the act on citizenship to ensure that all children born in the territory of
            Slovenia acquired Slovenian nationality if they were otherwise stateless.128
            74.    UNHCR stated that after Slovenia had declared independence, nationals of the
            former Yugoslavia who had permanent residence in Slovenia had been “erased”, as their
            names had been removed from the population registers in 1992. Despite the steps already
            taken to tackle the issue, the status of the “erased” persons still had not been resolved.129
            75.     The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted that under the Act
            of 2010 regulating the status of “erased” persons, applications for the restoration of
            residency status could be lodged only within three years from the date of entry into effect of
            the Act. Consequently, only a limited number of persons who had been subjected to the
            erasure had applied for the restoration of their residency status. 130 The Human Rights
            Committee expressed concern that there were no avenues for restoring the legal status of a
            significant number of “erased” persons since the expiry in 2013 of the 2010 Act to re-
            establish their permanent residency status. 131 The Special Rapporteur on minority issues, 132
            the Independent Expert on older persons, 133 the Committee on Economic, Social and
            Cultural Rights, 134 and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
            Women135 expressed similar concerns.
            76.   The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was concerned that the Act
            Regulating Compensation for Damage to Persons Erased from the Permanent Population

10
                                                                                                  A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/2


            Register (Compensation Act) excluded those who had not obtained legal status in Slovenia,
            and provided for inadequate financial compensation. 136 The Committee on the Elimination
            of Racial Discrimination was concerned that erased persons continued to face difficulties in
            accessing education, training and employment. 137
            77.     The Human Rights Committee recommended that Slovenia ensure that all remaining
            “erased” persons could restore their legal status without undue administrative constraints
            and that all “erased” persons were provided with full and effective reparation, including
            restitution and compensation. 138 UNHCR, 139 the Committee on the Elimination of
            Discrimination against Women, 140 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
            Rights, 141 the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 142 and the Special
            Rapporteur on minority issues143 made similar recommendations.
            78.    The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that
            Slovenia ensure the full enjoyment by erased persons of their rights with respect to access
            to education, training and employment, paying special attention to Roma who had been
            subjected to erasure.144
