            1.      This document contains the response of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia
            to the recommendations made during the 3rd Universal Periodic Review of Slovenia on 12
            November 2019. The Working Group’s report contains 215 recommendations.
            2.     On 12 November, Slovenia received 215 recommendations from UN member states,
            of which 58 were immediately supported. Many of the supported recommendations have
            already been implemented or are in the process of implementation. With this document,
            Slovenia sets out its position and rationale on the remaining 157 recommendations, of
            which 124 are now supported and 33 noted. The response is clustered into three categories:
            1. Accepted recommendations; 2. Accepted recommendations that Slovenia considers
            already implemented or are the in process of implementation; 3. Noted recommendations.


            Accepted recommendations
            3.     The Government accepts the following recommendations 122.1, 122.12, 122.17-18,
            122.22, 122.27, 122.30-33, 122.36-41, 122.43-44, 122.46-53, 122.56-57, 122.60, 122.62-
            66, 122.68-71, 122.76, 122.78, 122.82-85, 122.87-90, 122.105, 122.108-114, 122.116-117,
            122.121, 122.123-126, 122.128-131, 122.133, 122.137-139, 122.141-144,122.146, 122.148,
            122.150, 122.154, 122.156.


            Accepted recommendations that Slovenia considers already
            implemented or in the process of implementation
            4.     The Government accepts the following recommendations 122.11, 122.14-16,
            122.19-20, 122.23-24, 122.28, 122.34- 35, 122.45, 122.72-75, 122.79-81, 122.86, 122.91-
            104, 122.106-107, 122.115, 122.122, 122.134-136, 122.140, 122.145, 122.152. Slovenia
            considers that they are already implemented or are in the process of implementation and
            provides some additional information about the implementation.

            122.11
                   The activities for the implementation of this recommendation have already started.
            The line ministry is currently conducting an analysis of the impact that the ratification of
            the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance might have
            on the Slovenian criminal law.

            122.14– 15
                   Slovenia considers these recommendations implemented. Slovenia has a strong
            national human rights protection framework with the Human Rights Ombudsman and the
            Advocate of the Principle of Equality. In the framework of the judicial branch, the
            Constitutional Court decides on constitutional complaints stemming from the violation of
            human rights and fundamental freedoms by individual acts.
                  The funds necessary for the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman and the
            Advocate of the Principle of Equality are earmarked in the national budget of Slovenia
            adopted by the National Assembly.

            122.16
                   Slovenia considers this recommendation implemented. The Family Code adopted in
            2017 established the Council for Children and Families headed by the minister responsible
            for family affairs. In the area of the rights of the child, the amended Human Rights
            Ombudsman Act provides for child advocacy. Since 2018, children’s rights advocates have
            been part of the Office of the Ombudsman.

            122.19
                  Slovenia considers that the activities for the implementation of this recommendation
            are ongoing and have largely been implemented. Measures for the promotion and

enforcement of the human rights of young people are stipulated in the Organisation and
Financing of Education Act.

122.20
       Activities for the implementation of this recommendation have already started. An
inter-ministerial working group appointed by the Minister of Health is drafting an
amendment to the Mental Health Act.

122.23–24
        Slovenia will continue to promote gender equality, including by upgrading the
legislation in this field. In 2019, Slovenia introduced amendments to the Equal
Opportunities for Women and Men Act with the aim to increase the share of the under-
represented sex in the composition of the bodies of the Government and local authorities as
well as in the management of bodies governed by public law.

122.28
        Slovenia considers that the activities for the implementation of this recommendation
are ongoing. Eliminating racism and xenophobia and preventing all forms of discrimination
are stipulated in the Organisation and Financing of Education Act. For instance, in the
Principals Training Centre, which provides the training for principals of both pre-school
institutions and schools, their assistants and teachers, educational contents related to the
protection of human rights, particularly the rights of the child, are part of a special
programme.

122.34–35
       See recommendation 122.28. Upon the adoption of the Protection against
Discrimination Act, the Advocate of the Principle of Equality became an autonomous and
independent body. The Criminal Code of Slovenia already criminalises hate speech in
Article 297 (public incitement to hatred, violence and intolerance). The prohibition of
incitement to inequality and intolerance is stipulated in the Media Act and the Audiovisual
Media Services Act.

122.45
       The ministries are implementing numerous programmes and training workshops in
the form of education, promotion and prevention activities aimed at preventing public
incitement to hatred and intolerance.

122.72
       Several measures have already been introduced. The efforts to improve efficiency
continue. Under the Criminal Code, violence in the family or any other permanent
community is considered a criminal offence. A new Resolution on the national programme
for the prevention of family violence and violence against women 2020-2025 is being
drafted.

122.73
        Slovenia considers these recommendations implemented. The backlog of court cases
is no longer a systemic problem in Slovenia. In the last five years (as of the end of 2013),
the number of pending cases has decreased by 56 per cent.

122.74–75
       Slovenia considers these recommendations implemented. There are several
provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act of Slovenia providing for the right of access to a
lawyer for the defendant.




                                                                                                      3
A/HRC/43/15/Add.1


            122.79–81
                   Slovenia will continue to carry out the activities in the field of trafficking in human
            beings and fight against it in accordance with the 2019-2020 Action Plan for Combating
            Trafficking in Human Beings.

            122.86
                    Slovenia considers this recommendation implemented. In May 2016, the
            Government approved the Handbook for identifying, protecting and assisting victims of
            trafficking providing for the right to assistance and support for victims as soon as it can
            reasonably be assumed that they might have been victims of human trafficking.

            122.91–92
                   In Slovenia, access to health services is universal. Emergency healthcare is
            universally accessible. The public primary health care system in Slovenia provides free
            preventive and curative health care to all children and adolescents up to the age of 19.

            122.93
                    Under the 2010 National Programme, Slovenia supports new developments in
            palliative care in all areas of healthcare, and strives for enhanced medical care at primary
            level (in the home environment).

            122.94
                   Slovenia is implementing measures, which are closing the gap between the regions
            by allocating a greater share of funding for education projects to lesser developed regions.

            122.95–96
            The Organisation and Financing of Education Act provides for the right to the optimal
            development of the individual, irrespective of gender, social background or cultural
            identity, religion, racial, ethnic or national origin, and regardless of their physical and
            mental constitution or invalidity, and to develop and achieve the highest possible level of
            creativity. The Constitution stipulates that elementary education is compulsory.

            122.97
                    Slovenia considers these recommendations implemented. According to the
            Elementary School Act, children who are foreign citizens or stateless persons and reside in
            Slovenia have the right to compulsory elementary school education under the same
            conditions as citizens of Slovenia; persons granted international protection enjoy the right
            to pre-school, primary, secondary, higher and university education and adult education to
            the same degree as citizens of the Republic of Slovenia. Applicants for international
            protection have access to higher, university and adult education under the same conditions
            as citizens of the Republic of Slovenia.

            122.98
                   Slovenia considers that the activities for the implementation of this recommendation
            are already ongoing. These topics are included in the training programmes designed for
            border police officers and Police College students. The protection of human rights and
            fundamental freedoms in police procedures is also a compulsory subject in the regular
            training of police officers.

            122.99
            Slovenia will strive for continued progress in the implementation of strategies aimed at
            achieving gender equality in all spheres of economic, political and social life, including in
            employment and granting equal pay.

122.100
        The number of women in leading positions in companies has been gradually
increasing. In order to eliminate discrimination against women and close the gap in the
participation of men and women in the labour market, the Government regularly monitors
the position and role of women; its measures include the identification of obstacles in
achieving gender equality and designing tools for overcoming them.

122.101–103
       See recommendation 122.72.

122.104
        The Convention was ratified and internal legislation amended accordingly prior to
ratification.

122.106–107
        The activities for the implementation of this recommendation have already started.
The Ministry of Justice is currently conducting an analysis of possible changes of the
definition of the criminal offence of rape based on consent.

122.115
       See recommendations 122.95–96.

122.122
       Slovenia considers this recommendation implemented. Minority ethnic communities
in Slovenia (the Italian and Hungarian national communities and the Roma community) are
adequately represented in the elected bodies. The legal arrangements in force for the
minority protection of the three above-mentioned communities are adequate.

122.134–135
      In cooperation with relevant ministries, the competent Government Office for
National Minorities has already begun the activities to draft a new comprehensive national
programme of measures for Roma for the period 2021–2030.

122.136
      Slovenia considers this recommendation implemented. In 2018, the competent
Government Office for National Minorities commissioned an external evaluation of the
implementation of the National Programme of Measures for Roma for the Period 2017–
2021.

122.140
       The right to drinking water is enshrined in the Slovenian Constitution. The right to
drinking water has already been and will continue to be granted to all citizens and
inhabitants under the same conditions.

122.145
       Slovenia considers that the activities for the implementation of this recommendation
are ongoing. In 2019, the Government has adopted a comprehensive Migration Strategy
which addresses integration in its pillar IV. This section also includes vulnerable categories
of people.

122.152
       In accordance with the International Protection Act, persons applying for
international protection have access to all levels of education and are granted
accommodation, while in the field of healthcare, they have access to essential services;

                                                                                                        5
A/HRC/43/15/Add.1


            women are granted additional health services, and the same holds for other applicants, if so
            decided by a special commission. Children (under 18) have access to the same health
            services as granted to children who are citizens of Slovenia.


            Noted recommendations
            5.    For the time being, the Government notes recommendations 122.2-10, 122.13,
            122.21, 122.25-26, 122.29, 122.42, 122.54-55, 122.58-59, 122.61, 122.67, 122.77, 122.118-
            120, 122.127, 122.132, 122.147, 122.149, 122.151, 122.153, 122.155, 122.157. The
            Government wishes to provide the following additional information.

            122.2–4
                    The ratification of the Convention is not a priority for Slovenia, since the current
            legislation already guarantees migrant workers and their family members in the labour
            market and most of the rights enshrined in the Convention and reflects the objectives of the
            Convention. The rights of migrants are also protected by the existing EU legislation.

            122.5–9
                 The ratification of the convention is not a priority. The essential elements of the
            Convention are included in the Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia Act.

            122.10
                   The ratification of the convention is not a priority, since the protection granted by
            the current legislation ensures full protection also to domestic workers.

            122.13
                    The Government deems that no change is necessary in the public finance legislation.
            Since it is a public body, the Ombudsman is funded by the national budget, but remains
            fully independent and autonomous.

            122.21
                     The recommendation is incomprehensible.

            122.25–26
                    Slovenia does not deem this a priority since Slovenia already has sector specific
            legislation which together constitutes an integrated approach against all forms of
            discrimination.

            122.29
                   Slovenia does not see the need for legislative changes since the Protection Against
            Discrimination Act includes a definition of severe forms of discrimination, namely multiple
            discrimination, mass discrimination, continuous or repeated discrimination, and
            discrimination which has or might have consequences for the discriminated person that
            would be difficult to remedy in terms of damage caused to the person's legal status, rights
            or obligations, particularly if it affects children or other vulnerable persons.

            122.42
                   The Criminal Code of Slovenia already criminalises hate speech in Article 297
            (public incitement to hatred, violence and intolerance).

            122.54
                   Slovenia considers this recommendation implemented. We do not see the need to
            change the criminal justice system as it adequately addresses this type of criminal offences.
            See also recommendation 122.42 above.

122.55
       Slovenia does not see the need for legislative changes since racist intent can already
be considered an aggravating circumstance when determining the sentence prescribed by
the Criminal Code.

122.58
       To respond to this question, the Government has requested an opinion from experts
and the National Medical Ethics Committee, but they have not yet produced a final position
on the topic.

122.59
       The current legislation already envisages the presumption of paternity for children
born in civil partnership (the partner of the woman who gave birth to the child is considered
the child’s mother). Concerning unilateral adoptions, homosexual couples have an equal
position to heterosexual couples.

122.61
         See recommendation 122.58.

122.67
       Due to the constitutional separation of powers, the Commission for the Prevention
of Corruption cannot impose (adopt) a code of ethics that would be binding on the National
Assembly and the National Council, and cannot monitor the implementation of such a code.
However, each of these bodies may adopt its own code and establish a monitoring
mechanism.

122.77
        The Government is currently not planning to decriminalise defamation. Under
Article 159 of the Criminal Code, defamation is considered a criminal offence; however, it
envisages (with certain rare exceptions) only private prosecution. This shows that the public
interest for the prosecution of this criminal offence is smaller than in the case of criminal
offences prosecuted ex officio.

122.118
         See recommendation 122.58.

122.119
       The Government does not see the need to amend legislation for the promotion and
protection of the rights of national minorities as they already enjoy all cultural and
linguistic minority rights.

122.120
        The Government considers that the existing legislation guarantees all persons,
including members of national minorities, the right to non-discrimination, free expression
of their national affiliation, the fostering and expression of their culture and the right to use
their language and script.

122.127
       For historical reasons, Italian and Hungarian (autochthonous) national communities
enjoy a significant degree of autonomy and political representation. According to available
research, representatives of other national minorities on the territory of Slovenia cannot be
considered autochthonous communities with the same status as the aforementioned
communities.



                                                                                                           7
A/HRC/43/15/Add.1


            122.132
                  The Government deems the current regulation adequate and additional changes
            unnecessary.

            122.147
                   Slovenia deems the current regulation adequate. Applicants for and persons with
            international protection are granted access to healthcare and social protection, as well as to
            education, in accordance with the International Protection Act, which is compliant with the
            European asylum legislation. Slovenia does not allow, under any circumstances, the
            detention of children applying for international protection.

            122.149
                  Activities have been ongoing for a while. The national legislation in Slovenia
            complies with the European asylum legislation and international conventions.

            122.151
                   Slovenia deems the current regulation adequate and changes unnecessary. Activities
            have been ongoing for a while. Slovenia does not allow, under any circumstances, the
            detention of minors and unaccompanied minors applying for international protection.

            122.153
                    The International Protection Act fully complies with international obligations in the
            field of international protection and the European legislation in this area.

            122.155
                   Activities have been ongoing for a while. The Act Amending the Act Regulating the
            Legal Status of Citizens of Former Yugoslavia Living in the Republic of Slovenia, which
            entered into force on 24 July 2010, set a three-year deadline for submitting permanent
            residence permit applications. The legislative authorities assessed that this was long enough
            to allow all potential applicants to acquaint themselves with the Act and file their
            applications.

            122.157
                    Stateless persons may regulate their status in accordance with the provisions of the
            Aliens Act, unless direct application of the Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless
            Persons would be more favourable. Taking into consideration the above-mentioned
            clarifications we believe that, given a small number of stateless persons in Slovenia, there is
            no need for introducing a special statelessness determination procedure.
