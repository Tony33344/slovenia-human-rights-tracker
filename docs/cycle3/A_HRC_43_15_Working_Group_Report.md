              Introduction
              1.     The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance
              with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its thirty-fourth session from 4 to 15
              November 2019. The review of Slovenia was held at the 13th meeting, on 12 November
              2019. The delegation of Slovenia was headed by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
              Foreign Affairs, Miro Cerar. At its 17th meeting, held on 14 November 2019, the Working
              Group adopted the report on Slovenia.
              2.     On 15 January 2019, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of
              rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Slovenia: Bangladesh, Denmark and Egypt.
              3.     In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution
              5/1 and paragraph 5 of the annex to Council resolution 16/21, the following documents
              were issued for the review of Slovenia:
                     (a)    A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with
              paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/34/SVN/1);
                   (b)    A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High
              Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b)

              4.     A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Portugal, on behalf of the
              Group of Friends on national mechanisms for implementation, reporting and follow-up,
              Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
              America was transmitted to Slovenia through the troika. These questions are available on
              the website of the universal periodic review.


       I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process

      A.      Presentation by the State under review

              5.     The head of the delegation of Slovenia informed the Human Rights Council that the
              Government had prepared the national report by involving various ministries and other
              government institutions as well as national human rights institutions. The Government had
              also sought the views of representatives of civil society, through regular briefings.
              6.      Slovenia accorded high priority to the respect, protection and fulfilment of human
              rights. The universal periodic review process served as an additional incentive to make
              further improvements in that respect. Slovenia tasked the National Interministerial
              Commission for Human Rights with the implementation and monitoring of
              recommendations from the review. The Government had submitted a voluntary midterm
              report on the implementation of the recommendations from the previous cycle, in 2017.
              7.     Slovenia had fully or partially implemented 138 out of the total of 142
              recommendations that it had accepted. The delegation highlighted some of the
              achievements made since 2014. Slovenia had amended the Human Rights Ombudsman Act
              to broaden the mandate of the Ombudsman with a view to obtaining A status under the
              principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of
              human rights (the Paris Principles). The amended Act had established the Council of
              Human Rights, the Centre for Human Rights, and an institute of children’s advocates within
              the Office of the Ombudsman.
              8.     In 2016, the Protection against Discrimination Act had strengthened the mandate of
              the Advocate of the Principle of Equality to assist persons subjected to discrimination in
              administrative and judicial proceedings, to monitor protection against discrimination at the
              national level, and to implement preventive measures or redress discrimination, which

                                                                                                A/HRC/43/15


included awareness-raising and research activities in that area. The Advocate was
authorized to request a review of the constitutionality of legal acts.
9.       The delegation reiterated the commitment of Slovenia to the empowerment of
women and gender equality at the national and international levels. Slovenia had taken
several measures to prevent and combat domestic violence. The Government had submitted
its first national report on the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on
Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul
Convention), which had been ratified in 2014. The Government had carried out a number of
awareness-raising campaigns on domestic violence and cyberviolence and had expanded
the network of crisis centres and safe houses throughout the country. The Government had
implemented several programmes to prevent violence against older women. It had provided
funding for several projects relating to gender equality that were being implemented by
representatives of civil society.
10.     In 2016, Slovenia had adopted the Civil Union Act, granting heterosexual couples
and same-sex couples living in civil union the same rights as married couples, except in
relation to medically assisted procreation and joint adoption of children.
11.     The Government had taken additional measures to resolve the status of persons
erased from the register of permanent residents of Slovenia after the dissolution of
Yugoslavia. Slovenia had adopted a law to enable every “erased” person to claim just
compensation. In 2016, the Council of Europe had deemed the implementation of the
related judgment of the European Court of Human Rights satisfactory, and had concluded
its supervision over the matter.
12.    Slovenia had made considerable progress in reducing a backlog of court cases and
shortening the length of trials to ensure the right to fair trial without undue delays.
13.    The Government had adopted a zero-tolerance approach towards hate speech. Public
incitement to hatred, violence or intolerance was a criminal offence under certain
circumstances, punishable by imprisonment. The promotion of tolerance and of respect for
diversity were among the goals of the public education system. A special website allowed
anonymous reporting of hate speech and other illegal web content. The Ministry of Culture
had concluded public consultations on a new Media Act aimed at adapting legislation to the
new digital media reality by including provisions to counter hate speech in the media,
including online and through new digital media.
14.    In 2018, Slovenia had adopted its first National Action Plan on Business and Human
Rights.
15.    In 2016, Slovenia had incorporated the right to drinking water in the Constitution, in
order to guarantee access to drinking water to all on a non-profit basis.
16.    The Constitution guaranteed freedom of expression, and the Constitution and the
Media Act adequately protected the right to public information. In 2019, Slovenia had
started to amend the relevant legislation to ensure, inter alia, financial support for the
development of independent media operating in the public interest.
17.     The Government had established the Expert Group for Solving Spatial Issues in
Roma Settlements, with a view to resolving issues concerning access to water, sanitation
and electricity for Roma, as a guideline for the future work of the State authorities,
municipalities and other institutions. Local communities provided the basic communal
infrastructure to about 75 per cent of the Roma settlements, with funding from the State
budget and from European Union funds. The National Programme of Measures for Roma
for the period 2017–2021 included measures to prevent discrimination against Roma and to
ensure social inclusion of Roma. Members of the Roma minority could access legal aid in
line with criteria established by the Legal Aid Act.
18.     The Domestic Violence Prevention Act included provisions prohibiting corporal
punishment. The amendments of 2017 to the Organization and Financing of Education Act
prohibited corporal punishment of children in kindergartens, schools, and educational
institutions for children and young people with special needs.



                                                                                                          3
A/HRC/43/15


              19.     The delegation emphasized that fighting corruption remained one of the priorities of
              the State Prosecutor General. The Government had submitted to Parliament amendments to
              the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act aimed at improving further legislation and
              enabling the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption to perform its tasks more
              effectively. The Government had adopted the Programme on Anti-Corruption Measures for
              2017–2019, which contained measures to strengthen the integrity of public employees, high
              officials and other employees in the public sector and to increase the transparency of
              operations in the public sector.
              20.     Slovenia had comprehensive laws on the restitution of property and ensured the
              return of properties confiscated during the Second World War. The Ministry of Justice and
              the World Jewish Restitution Organization had jointly commissioned a study in 2018 to
              evaluate the extent of heirless Jewish-owned properties from that period. The Ministry of
              Justice would take appropriate measures after having analysed findings of the study.
              21.     In 2013, the Constitutional Court had ruled that restrictions on ritual slaughter
              contained in the Animal Protection Act were in line with the Constitution, arguing that the
              restrictions protected animals from suffering that could be prevented without
              disproportionately infringing on religious freedom.


      B.      Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

              30.     Turkey noted with appreciation the considerable progress made in ratifying
              additional international human rights treaties and strengthening the legislative framework

              since the review of 2014.
              31.    Ukraine commended Slovenia for its strong commitment to human rights. Ukraine

              32.    The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland commended Slovenia

              59.   Djibouti welcomed the ratification of the Istanbul Convention and the Optional
              Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure. It
              encouraged Slovenia to allocate adequate resources for the functioning of the office of the
              Advocate of the Principle of Equality.
              60.   The Dominican Republic welcomed the efforts of Slovenia to protect and promote

              61.    Ecuador noted the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the
              Rights of the Child on a communications procedure and the establishment of the Advocate
              of the Principle of Equality, and projects implemented to eradicate cyberviolence against
              women and children and to integrate foreigners into society.
              62.    The delegation of Slovenia stated that the legal framework included strong legal
              protection for the rights of all minorities, which included preservation of their culture and
              languages. The Italian and Hungarian minorities were constitutionally recognized
              autochthonous minorities with a special status. In 2018, the Special Rapporteur on minority

                                                                                                   A/HRC/43/15


issues had identified several good practices and positive developments in the protection of
minorities in Slovenia.
63.     The delegation highlighted several measures taken in the area of migration,
including the establishment of the Government Office for the Support and Integration of
Migrants and the adoption of the National Strategy on Migration. The Government
provided migrant children, regardless of their status, with access to the educational system
at all levels, no later than three months after their arrival, under the same conditions as
Slovenian citizens, and provided them with free Slovenian language courses. Migrant
children received medical treatment and adult migrants received urgent medical treatment,
with State funding. During the influx of migrants in 2015 and 2016, the Government dealt
with migration in a humane manner by providing migrants with necessary shelter, food, and
access to health care.
64.     Slovenia had made significant progress in protecting the rights of persons with
disabilities, since its second universal periodic review. Parliament had adopted four laws,
concerning the rights of persons with severe disabilities, personal assistance systems,
accessibility for persons with disabilities, and their right to vote through effective access to
polling stations and alternative voting methods.
65.     Slovenia had focused its efforts to prevent human trafficking and had carried out
several awareness-raising activities, targeted at the general public, and, particularly, at
children, young persons, migrant workers and asylum seekers. Slovenia enforced the legal
provisions criminalizing human trafficking with harsh punishments prescribed in the
legislation addressing this crime, and put emphasis on international and regional
cooperation in combating it.
66.    The delegation explained that article 297 of the Criminal Code addressed hate
speech without using the term “hate speech” but categorizing it under the criminal offence
of public incitement to hatred, violence or intolerance. A recent decision of the Supreme
Court had broadened the narrow interpretation of this offence. Discriminatory, racist or
similar motives could be taken into account as an aggravating factor under the current
criminal law.
67.     The Government had adopted measures to improve the access of women to
employment and close the gender pay gap. The delegation noted a certain decrease in the
representation of women in the recent parliamentary elections, but emphasized that
otherwise there was a high representation of women in the political life of the country and
legislation was in place to ensure a high level of representation of women in decision-
making positions.
68.    Slovenia had established the institute of children’s advocates in the Office of the
Ombudsman to ensure protection of the rights of children in judicial and administrative
