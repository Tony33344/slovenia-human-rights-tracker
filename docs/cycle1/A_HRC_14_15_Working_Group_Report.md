            Views on conclusions and/or recommendations presented by
            the State under review
                   Slovenia welcomes the recommendations made during its Universal Periodic
            Review on 16 February 2010. After evaluating the recommendations, its answers are as
            follows:
            1.                   Slovenia cannot, at this point in time, make a definitive statement.
                                 Slovenia already guarantees most of the rights contained in the
                                 Convention to migrant workers and their family members on its labour
                                 market and shares the objectives of the Convention.
            2.                   Slovenia accepts the recommendation. The issue of ratifying the
                                 International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from
                                 Enforced Disappearance is under review in Slovenia, especially from
                                 the aspect of preliminary harmonisation of the internal legal order with
                                 the provisions of the Convention.
            3.                   The Slovenian Government accepts the recommendations on ratifying
                                 the 1993 Convention on the Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents
                                 (No. 174). The Act ratifying the latter entered into force on 23
                                 December 2009. However, at this point in time, it cannot make a
                                 definitive statement regarding potential ratification of the 1962 ILO
                                 Equality of Treatment (Social Security) Convention (No. 118).
            4.                   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and will continue to implement
                                 international human rights standards, in particular with regard to
                                 persons with disabilities, migrants, asylum seekers, refugees, women
                                 and children, within its legal framework.
            5., 6., 7., 8., 9.   The Slovenian Government accepts these recommendations. The draft
                                 Family Code adopted by the Government in December 2009 and
                                 submitted to the National Assembly for adoption equates, in all
                                 elements, same-sex civil partnership with other family unions. Marriage
                                 is in the draft Family Code defined as a partnership between two
                                 persons of the same or opposite sex.
                                 The draft Family Code prohibits corporal punishment of children and
                                 other forms of degrading treatment, and is binding on parents and other
                                 persons, state bodies, and public officials. The 2008 Domestic Violence
                                 Prevention Act classifies different forms of violence.
            10.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation, which has already been
                                 implemented to a great extent. The institution of the Human Rights
                                 Ombudsman has been strengthened by legislation in 2006, granting
                                 additional monitoring powers, additional staff (specialised persons from
                                 non-governmental organisations), and financial resources.
            11.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that recommended
                                 activities have already been implemented to a great extent or in full.
            12.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that it has already
                                 acted accordingly. The Slovenian Government has adopted a number of
                                 programmes and action plans, as well as legislative provisions in the
                                 field of children’s rights. A call centre has also been set up for the
                                 anonymous reporting of illegal internet content.

13.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already implemented it.
      The first Programme for Children and Youth 2006–2016 was adopted
      in 2006 and the implementation of the Programme has been set out in
      the Action Plan for 2009–2010.
14.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation. Further activities in this area are
      envisaged in the Action Plan for the implementation of the National
      Programme for Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 2005–2013.
15.   Slovenia agrees with the importance of the 1995 Programme of
      Measures for Assisting the Roma and the positive actions for a better
      integration of Roma community members into society. Slovenia also
      notes the adoption of the new, integrated National Programme of
      Measures for the Roma for the Period 2010–2015 on 11 March this
      year. This document contains measures for the key areas in which
      Roma still face discrimination, or in which specific positive measures
      are needed, such as education and schooling, health care, employment,
      living conditions, culture, and the fight against discrimination. Each
      measure of the programme has its own implementation timeline, and a
      special government body has already been established to monitor the
      implementation. Monitoring is scheduled to take place once a year.
16.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that the new Action
      Plan for 2010–2011 has retained all activities in this area.
17.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation in the sense that it has already
      been implemented in general action plans for the prevention of
      trafficking in human beings and for the protection of children. It also
      notes that, according to statistical data contributed by NGOs, in 2008, 3
      persons out of 68 victims of offences related to trafficking in human
      beings were minors.
18.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already implemented it
      to a great extent.
19.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
20.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
21.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has always acted
      accordingly.
22.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation; it has already been implemented
      to a large extent.
23.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already taken steps to
      ensure monitoring and assessment of the effectiveness of the adopted
      measures.
24.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that it has already
      designed and implemented various measures for the protection and
      promotion of the rights of women and children.
25.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation and will continue initiatives for
      the elimination of gender stereotypes and discriminatory attitudes.
26.   Slovenia accepts the recommendation. At the same time, it notes that it
      has always acted accordingly.




                                                                                         3
A/HRC/14/15/Add.1


            27.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation; it has already been implemented
                             to a large extent.
            28.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has always acted
                             accordingly.
            29.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation and acts accordingly. When
                             adopting measures in various fields of social life, special attention is
                             devoted to elimination of discrimination against Roma, including in the
                             National Programme of Measures for the Roma for the Period 2010–
                             2015.
            30.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation on the understanding that this is
                             not a serious and widespread problem. Slovenia views this
                             recommendation as a general and permanent one in the field of human
                             rights protection. Cases of ill treatment by law enforcement officers
                             occur very rarely in Slovenia, where police exceeding their powers is
                             not a systemic problem. Slovenia believes that this recommendation has
                             already been implemented and will continue its efforts to adequately
                             regulate this field.
            31.              Slovenia accepts this recommendation. It is already being implemented
                             through systematic education and training of police and training of
                             members of the judiciary.
                             Efforts to achieve these objectives will continue.
            32.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation regarding the treatment of those
                             responsible for domestic violence. Options for treatment are provided in
                             partnership with NGOs.
                             Slovenia also      accepts    recommendation         on   awareness-raising
                             campaigns.
                             Slovenia cannot accept the recommendation to promulgate a law on
                             domestic violence due to the national system of criminal legislation. In
                             Slovenia, criminal offences and sanctions are defined in the Criminal
                             Code and in the Minor Offences Act.
            33., 34., 35.    Slovenia accepts these recommendations and has already implemented
                             them to a great extent.
            36.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already implemented it to
                             a great extent.
            37.              Slovenia accepts this recommendation and is planning to gradually
                             expand the network of crisis centres and shelters for women victims of
                             violence, particularly in those parts of the country, where such services
                             have not been available so far.
            38.              Slovenia accepts the recommendation and will continue to place special
                             emphasis to awareness-raising campaigns concerning violence against
                             women and domestic violence.
            39.              Slovenia accepts this recommendation and already acts accordingly.
            40., 41., 42.,   Slovenia accepts these recommendations and already acts accordingly.
            43., 44.
            45.              Slovenia accepts this recommendation and already acts accordingly.

46.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
47.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that it has been already
                     implemented to a great extent.
48.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that current border
                     control mechanisms are adequate. Police officers have been trained to
                     recognise trafficking in human beings through appropriate "train the
                     trainers" programmes.
49.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
50., 51., 52.        Slovenia accepts these recommendations and notes that they have
                     already been implemented to a great extent by the new Criminal Code
                     adopted in 2008. The Criminal Code may be additionally amended by
                     legislative action in this area at the end of 2010.
53.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already implemented it
                     in action plans against trafficking in human beings, as well as through
                     other projects.
54., 55., 56., 57.   Slovenia accepts these recommendations. The reform process for
                     improving efficiency in the judicial system is underway. Slovenia
                     continues to introduce several projects to abolish court backlogs.
                     Changes in judicial and procedural legislation are being adopted, are
                     under discussion or are already being implemented.
58.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation regarding free legal aid and notes
                     that it already acts accordingly.
                     Slovenia cannot accept the recommendation on specialised family
                     courts. Slovenia aims to gradually and systematically strengthen the
                     existing family departments at district courts and facilitate the creation
                     of new ones, if the need for such departments is independently
                     established by the judiciary. The introduction of new courts with sole
                     jurisdiction over family relations/children could cause new court
                     backlogs or lengthy trials.
59., 60.             Slovenia accepts these recommendations as freedom of religion is one
                     of its constitutional principles and it has, and always will, strive for its
                     full implementation. The relevant law is under constitutional review
                     and the Slovenian Government is in the process of drafting
                     amendments.
61.                  Slovenia accepts this recommendation; it has already been
                     implemented in the Criminal Code, and in the Implementation of the
                     Principle of Equal Treatment Act.
62.                  Slovenia accepts this recommendation and notes that there are no
                     formal restrictions, especially in the light of the 2007 Religious
                     Freedom Act.
63.                  The Slovenian Government accepts this recommendation; it already
                     acts accordingly. At the same time, it notes with respect to the Deputies
                     of the National Assembly (Members of Parliament) that speech which
                     may be interpreted in this way, if arising from the Deputies within the
                     proceedings of the National Assembly, should be considered, by virtue
                     of Article 83 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, as an issue
                     of parliamentary autonomy and parliamentary immunity/privilege. Any


                                                                                                           5
A/HRC/14/15/Add.1


                                 regulation in this sphere is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                                 National Assembly.
            64.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
            65., 66., 67., 68.   Slovenia accepts these recommendations and notes that the Slovenian
                                 Government has already introduced several measures that guarantee
                                 equal participation of women and men in government committees,
                                 commissions and other public bodies. The Government is determined to
                                 continue its efforts to strengthen the position of women in decision-
                                 making. Further steps are envisaged by proposing amendments to the
                                 National Assembly Elections Act, introducing more binding measures
                                 for increasing the number of women in political decision-making.
                                 Equal remuneration between men and women is guaranteed by the
                                 Employment Relationships Act.
            69., 70.             Slovenia accepts these recommendations and has already implemented
                                 them. Diverse measures have been taken to combat discrimination
                                 against women in employment. ILO recommendations on equal pay in
                                 public and private sectors are implemented through the Employment
                                 Relationships Act.
            71.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already designed and
                                 implemented various measures for the key areas in which Roma still
                                 face discrimination or in which specific positive measures are needed. It
                                 will continue with these activities.
            72.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and notes that it has already
                                 implemented it through the Employment Relationships Act.
            73.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has already designed and
                                 implemented various measures to improve the living conditions of the
                                 Roma population. Providing appropriate housing to the Roma
                                 community and its members remains one of the state’s priority tasks
                                 and, for this reason, appropriate measures have also been envisaged in
                                 the National Programme of Measures for the Roma for the Period
                                 2010–2015.
            74.                  Slovenia accepts this recommendation and will take further steps to
                                 monitor the implementation and success of the clinical and public-
                                 health measures already in place. At the same time, it has noted that
                                 maternal mortality rates already show a decreasing trend (from 15.1
                                 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000–2002 to 9.4/100,000
                                 live births in the 2003–2005 period; in absolute numbers – for the last
                                 period, 5 cases of early maternal deaths and 3 cases of late maternal
                                 deaths).
            75.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation to pursue its national efforts to
                                 integrate human-rights education (HRE); HRE is already integrated into
                                 the Slovenian school system and training programmes, and Slovenia
                                 also plans to pursue this issue at the international level.
            76.                  Slovenia accepts the recommendation and has always acted
                                 accordingly.

77., 78., 79., 82.,   Slovenia accepts these recommendations and refers, in the light of the
83., 85., 86., 87.    decision by the Slovenian Constitutional Court in 2003, to the Act
                      Amending the Act regulating the Legal Status of Citizens of Former
                      Yugoslavia living in the Republic of Slovenia, which was developed by
                      the Slovenian Government and presented to the National Assembly for
                      adoption under a simplified procedure. The Act was dealt with by the
                      National Assembly and adopted on 8 March 2010. The Act provides for
                      a restoration of the residency status and registration of permanent
                      residence with retroactive effect, under certain conditions, for all
                      citizens of the former Yugoslavia, whose names were removed from the
                      population register in 1992, allowing them to submit an application
                      within three years of the date of adoption of the Act. Under the
                      amended Act, permanent residence permits will also be made available
                      to "erased persons" who do not live in Slovenia, if it is established
                      during the procedure that they have been absent for well-founded
                      reasons that do not terminate the actual residence requirement as
                      defined by the Act.
                      Compensation claims by persons whose permanent residence has been
                      terminated ("erased persons") are dealt with by relevant Slovenian
                      courts under the general principles of compensation legislation.
                      Therefore the Government is not drafting any special measures
                      regarding the matter.
80.                   Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
81.                   Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
84.                   Slovenia cannot accept the recommendation for the following reasons:
                      •   The Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia Act, which took effect
                          on 25 June 1991, failed to introduce a basis for withdrawing
                          citizenship of persons who, on 23 December 1990, had Yugoslav
                          citizenship in addition to the citizenship of another republic of the
                          former SFRY, but allowed these persons to obtain Slovenian
                          citizenship under favourable terms. Under these favourable terms,
                          Slovenian citizenship has been obtained by 171,136 persons (Article
                          40 of the Citizenship Act). All of these persons also retained their
                          original citizenship.
                      •   The Act Amending the Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia Act,
                          which took effect on 29 November 2002, also introduced favourable
                          terms for these persons, and 1,757 persons obtained Slovenian
                          citizenship (Article 19č of the Citizenship Act). All of them also
                          retained their original citizenship.
                      •   Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia may be obtained by any
                          alien who applies and fulfils cumulatively all the conditions in
                          accordance with the Citizenship of the Republic of Slovenia Act;
                          there are no more favourable conditions for the "erased".
88.                   Slovenia does not accept this recommendation, as it is
                      incomprehensible and contrary. Slovenia’s responses to similar
                      recommendations relating to the issue of the "erased" and the issue of
                      ethnic groups are provided within the scope of the responses to other
                      recommendations.



                                                                                                         7
A/HRC/14/15/Add.1


            89.        Slovenia accepts the recommendation, as it has always acted
                       accordingly. Articles 14, 61, and 62 of the Constitution of the Republic
                       of Slovenia guarantee to members of all national minorities full
                       exercise of their individual rights to maintain their national, linguistic
                       and cultural characteristics. The Government will continue with the
                       implementation of adopted measures to promote, develop and preserve
                       the ethnic and national identities of minorities.
            90.        Slovenia accepts the recommendation. It has already been implemented
                       to a large extent.
            91.        Slovenia accepts the recommendation. It has already been implemented
                       to a large extent.
            92.        Slovenia accepts the recommendation. It will continue with its efforts to
                       guarantee the protection and implementation of the rights of the Italian
                       national minority in Slovenia.
            93.        Slovenia cannot accept the recommendation. The rights of the German-
                       speaking community in Slovenia are adequately regulated by a bilateral
                       agreement and the Programme on Cooperation in Culture, Education
                       and Science between the Government of the Republic of Slovenia and
                       the Government of the Republic of Austria for the Period 2008–2012.
                       Members of the German-speaking community enjoy full exercise of
                       their individual rights to maintain their national, linguistic, and cultural
                       characteristics, in accordance with Articles 14, 61, and 62 of the
                       Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia. The Government will
                       continue to implement the adopted measures to promote, develop and
                       preserve the ethnic and national identities of this minority.
            94., 95.   Slovenia accepts these recommendations and has already designed and
                       implemented various measures for the key areas in which Roma still
                       face discrimination, or in which specific positive measures are needed.
                       It will continue with these activities.
            96.        Slovenia accepts the recommendation and would like to underline that
                       the Slovenian Government has already established an inter-
                       departmental working group to draw up an act amending the
                       International Protection Act.
                       Slovenia works with UNHCR in all areas of international protection.
                       Recently, the Asylum System Quality Assurance and Evaluation
                       Mechanism Project has been completed, which was also conducted in
                       other Central and Eastern European countries.
            97.        Slovenia accepts the recommendation.
